#  About The Residential Tenancies Tribunal

There is no legal aid for tenancy issues in New Brunswick.

We hope to change that, but in the meantime, if you have a problem with your tenancy, you must contact the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for help.

## What is the Residential Tenancies Tribunal?

An arms-length government body that

- Tries to resolve conflicts between landlords and tenants.
- Upholds and enforces the _Residential Tenancies Act_
- Does not _represent_ landlords or tenants, but provides support to both.

## **What can the Tribunal do?** 

- Administer security deposits.
- Investigate complaints.
- Work to settle conflicts between landlords and tenants.
- Issue orders (orders from the Tribunal are binding)

## **What kind of problems can the Tribunal help with?** 

The Tribunal can help with many different tenancy problems: managing security deposits, resolving conflicts between landlords and tenants, investigating emergency situations.

Emergency situations include:

- Disconnecting utilities (heat, water, electric power, natural gas)
- Plumbing leaks or back-ups
- Active destruction of premises
- Unauthorized lock change by landlord
- Immediate (meaning same or next day) threat of eviction by landlord
- Flood or fire

The Tribunal can also act when your landlord has retaliated against you. For example, the landlord cannot issue a notice of termination to you in retaliation for filing a complaint. If you believe this has happened, you can contact the Tribunal and seek their help.

## **How Do I Resolve a Conflict with My Landlord?**

Before applying to the tribunal for help, two steps must have been taken:

1.  First bring the issue to the landlord’s attention. If the landlord still does nothing to fix the problem;
2.  Put the complaint in writing and give it to the landlord. This is a [form](https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb7001/b/1000/CSS-FOL-SNB-45-0113B.pdf) you can use to submit a notice of complaint. You can also submit a complaint without using the form by writing an email or a letter. The letter must have:

    - The date
    - Your signature
    - The premises in question
    - Be addressed to the landlord
    - Highlight the issues you would like to have addressed
    - A time frame for the issues to be resolved (usually no less than one week unless the issue constitutes an emergency, as listed below).

It is important to give one copy of the letter to the landlord and keep one for yourself. It will be needed when applying to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for assistance later.

The Tribunal will try to find a solution that works for both you and your landlord. If this is not possible, they will judge in favor of one of you.

## **Appeal**

The Tribunal’s decision can be appealed at the Court of Queen’s Bench, but only if there is an issue in law or if the Residential Tenancies Officer did not have authority in that area.

If you have an unresolved problem that, after proper notice, your landlord still refuses to acknowledge, we encourage you to reach out to the Residential Tenancies Tribunals with your concern.

**Do you feel like the tribunal does not have the power to address tenant concerns? You are not alone!**

- The tribunal’s job is to uphold the Residential Tenancies Act, which has some of the weakest tenant protections in Canada.
