10(4)Where no collective agreement is in force and where an employer and a trade union have entered into a recognition agreement and where the Board has not made a declaration under [section 29](#sec29_smooth), another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the recognition agreement only after the expiry of twelve months from the date that the recognition agreement was entered into.

1971, c.9, s.13

##### Appropriate units

13(1)Upon an application for certification as bargaining agent for employees in a unit, the Board shall determine whether the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining and the Board may before certification, if it deems it appropriate to do so, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit, and the Board may, before determining the unit, take such steps as it deems appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the wishes of the employees as to the appropriateness of the unit.

13(2)Upon an application for certification within subsection (1), any group of employees, who exercise technical skills or who are members of a craft by reason of which they are distinguishable from the other employees and commonly bargain separately and apart from other employees through a trade union that according to established trade union practice pertains to such skills or craft, shall be deemed by the Board to be a unit appropriate for collective bargaining if the application is made by a trade union pertaining to such skills or craft, and the Board may include in such unit persons who according to established trade union practice are commonly associated in their work and bargaining with such group; but the Board is not required to apply this subsection where the group of employees is included in a bargaining unit represented by another bargaining agent at the time the application is made, or where the group of employees is exercising a combination of technical skills or is required to perform the skills in whole or in part of more than one craft as part of a work crew or team, the other members of which are also required to perform in similar fashion.

13(3)Where the Board has certified a trade union as the bargaining agent for a unit of employees that comprises members of a fire department and other employees and where that bargaining agent makes an application to the Board for a separate certification for a unit of employees comprising only those members of a fire department, the members of the fire department shall be deemed to be a unit appropriate for collective bargaining.

##### Representation vote

14(1)When, pursuant to an application for certification under this Act by a trade union, the Board has determined that a unit of employees is appropriate for collective bargaining, the Board shall ascertain the number of employees in the bargaining unit at the date the application was made and the number of employees in the unit who were members of the trade union at such time as is determined under [paragraph 126(2)](#sec126subsec2_smooth)(e).

14(2)If the Board is satisfied that not less than forty per cent and not more than sixty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit are members in good standing of the trade union, the Board may direct that a representation vote be taken.

14(3)If, on the taking of a representation vote, more than fifty per cent of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in favour of the trade union, and, in other cases, if the Board is satisfied that more than sixty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit are members in good standing of the trade union, the Board shall certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the bargaining unit.

14(4)In determining the number of eligible voters for the purpose of subsection (3), employees who are absent from work during voting hours and who do not cast their ballots shall not be counted as eligible.

15(3)The Board may direct that the ballot box containing the ballots cast in a representation vote taken under subsection (2) be sealed and that the ballots not be counted until the parties have been given full opportunity to present evidence and make representations.

15(4)Where a representation vote has been taken under subsection (2), the Board shall determine the unit of employees that is appropriate for collective bargaining and, if it is satisfied that not less than forty per cent of the employees in such bargaining unit were members of the trade union at the time the application was made, the representation vote taken under subsection (2) has the same effect as a representation vote taken under [subsection 14(2)](#sec14subsec2_smooth).

49(10)An application under subsection (5) or (6) by a trade union or council of trade unions does not affect any obligation of the trade union or council of trade unions to bargain collectively under the provisions of this Act, but the Board, pending disposition of the application or on disposition, may extend any time limits applicable to collective bargaining under this Act as the circumstances may require.

##### Settlement of grievances

55(1)Every collective agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration or otherwise, without stoppage of work, of all differences between the parties to, or persons bound by, the agreement or on whose behalf it was entered into, concerning its interpretation, application, administration or an alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable.

55(2)Where a collective agreement does not contain such a provision as is mentioned in subsection (1), it shall be deemed to contain the following provision:

“Where a difference arises between the parties relating to the interpretation, application or administration of this agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable, or where an allegation is made that this agreement has been violated, either of the parties may, after exhausting any grievance procedure established by this agreement, notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the difference or allegation to arbitration and the notice shall contain the name of the person appointed to the arbitration board by the party giving the notice. The party to whom the notice is given shall, within five days of receiving the notice, name the person whom it appoints to the arbitration board and shall advise the other party of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. The two appointees so selected shall, within five days of the appointment of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be the chairman. Where the party receiving the notice fails to appoint a member of the arbitration board, or where the two appointees of the parties fail to agree upon a chairman within the time limited, the Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour for New Brunswick, upon the request of a party to the agreement, shall appoint a member on behalf of the party failing to make an appointment, or shall appoint the third member, as the case may be, and, where the case requires, shall appoint both. The arbitration board shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall issue a decision and the decision is final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee or employer affected by it. The decision of a majority is the decision of the arbitration board, but, if there is no majority, the decision of the chairman shall be the decision of the arbitration board.”

55(3)The provisions of subsection (2) apply to arbitrations commenced after March 31, 1972 and to arbitrations commenced before subsection (2) comes into force and in respect of which the arbitrator or arbitration board has heard no evidence, notwithstanding that the collective agreement under which the arbitration was commenced was entered into before April 1, 1972.

55(4)Where, in the opinion of the Board, any part of the arbitration provisions in a collective bargaining agreement, including the method of appointment of the arbitrator or arbitration board, is inadequate, or the provisions set out in subsection (2) are unsuitable in any particular case, the Board, on the application of a party to the collective agreement, may modify any such provision in such manner as not to conflict with subsection (1), but, until so modified, the arbitration provision in the collective agreement or in subsection (2), as the case may be, applies.

55(5)Where a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, provides for a panel of arbitrators jointly appointed or nominated thereto by the parties, the parties may at any time, except with respect to an arbitrator who has been appointed or designated to an arbitration or except with respect to a board of arbitration that is constituted, where he or it has entered upon a hearing, remove, substitute or add the names of persons to the panel and may modify any such provision in such manner as not to conflict with subsection (1), but, until so modified, or modified pursuant to subsection (4), the arbitration provision in the collective agreement applies.

55(6)Where a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, provides for arbitration before a three member board, or is deemed to provide for such a board by virtue of subsection (2), the parties may at any time, except with respect to an arbitration board which is constituted, and has entered upon a hearing, substitute therefor a provision applicable for the term of the agreement or for the term mentioned in the substituted provision, for arbitration before a single arbitrator and the parties may appoint a person to be the arbitrator or provide for appointment from a panel of arbitrators, but until so modified, or modified pursuant to subsection (4), the arbitration provision in the collective agreement or deemed to be included therein by virtue of subsection (2) applies.

##### Effect of collective agreements

56(1)There shall be only one collective agreement at a time between a trade union or council of trade unions and an employer or employers’ organization with respect to the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the collective agreement.

56(2)A collective agreement is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employer and upon the trade union that is a party to the agreement whether or not the trade union is certified and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement.

56(3)A collective agreement between an employers’ organization and a trade union or council of trade unions is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employers’ organization and each person who was a member of the employers’ organization at the time the agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the employers’ organization bargained with the trade union or council of trade unions as if it was made between each of such persons and the trade union or council of trade unions and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement and, if any such person ceases to be a member of the employers’ organization during the term of operation of the agreement, he shall, for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a like agreement with the trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be.

56(4)A collective agreement between a certified council of trade unions and an employer is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon each trade union that is a constituent union of such a council as if it had been made between each of such trade unions and the employer.

56(5)A collective agreement between a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, and an employer or an employers’ organization is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the council of trade unions and each trade union that was a member of or affiliated with the council of trade unions at the time the agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the council of trade unions bargained with the employer or employers’ organization as if it was made between each of such trade unions and the employer or employers’ organization, and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement, and, if any such trade union ceases to be a member of or affiliated with the council of trade unions during the term of operation of the agreement, it shall, for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a like agreement with the employer or employers’ organization, as the case may be.

1971, c.9, s.57

##### Deemed provisions of collective agreements

57(1)Where a collective agreement does not provide for its term of operation or provides for its operation for an unspecified term or for a term of less than one year, it shall be deemed to provide for its operation for a term of one year from the date that it commenced to operate.

57(2)Where a collective agreement, or an arbitration award made under [section 79](#sec79_smooth) or [80](#sec80_smooth), or a conciliation board award made under [section 69](#sec69_smooth), does not specify a commencement date, the agreement or award shall be deemed to commence on the first day of the month next following the month in which the agreement is executed or the award is made, as the case may be, and a collective agreement incorporating any such award shall be deemed to commence on the date of the commencement of the award.

57(3)Notwithstanding subsection (2), the parties may, before or after a collective agreement has ceased to operate, agree to continue its operation or any of its provisions for a period of less than one year while they are bargaining for its renewal or revision or for a new agreement, but such continued operation does not bar an application for certification or for a declaration that the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit.

57(4)Where a collective agreement is for a term longer than one year, the agreement shall contain or be deemed to contain a provision for the termination of the agreement

(a) at any time after the first year, by consent of the parties to the agreement, or

57(7)Nothing in this section prevents the revision by consent of the parties at any time of any provision of a collective agreement other than a provision relating to the term of operation.

1971, c.9, s.58
