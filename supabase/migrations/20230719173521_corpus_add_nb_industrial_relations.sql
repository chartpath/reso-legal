8(1)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the parties to a collective agreement may include in the agreement provisions for requiring, as a condition of employment, membership in the trade union that is a party to or is bound by the agreement, granting a preference of employment to members of the trade unions, or requiring the payment of dues or contributions to the trade union.

8(2)Where a person is required by the terms of a collective agreement to be a member of a specified trade union, his membership or application for membership shall not be affected by any terms or conditions not applicable to other members.

8(3)No trade union that is party to or bound by a collective agreement, containing a provision mentioned in subsection (1), shall require the employer to discharge an employee where such employee has been expelled or suspended from membership, or denied membership in the trade union where

(a) the reason for expulsion, suspension or denial of membership is that the employee was or is a member of another trade union, or has engaged in activity against the trade union or on behalf of another trade union, or

(b) the employee has been discriminated against by the trade union in the application of its membership rules in circumstances where the employee is qualified to engage in the trade or work and is otherwise eligible for membership.

8(4)Subsection (3) does not apply to an employee who has engaged in unlawful activity against the trade union mentioned in subsection (1) or an officer or representative thereof, or whose activity against the trade union or on behalf of another trade union has been instigated or procured by the employer or a person acting on behalf of the employer, or whose employer or a person acting on behalf of the employer has participated in such activity or contributed financial or other support to the employee in respect of such activity.

8(5)A trade union or council of trade unions and the employer of the employees concerned shall not enter into a collective agreement that includes provisions requiring, as a condition of employment, membership in the trade union that is a party to or is bound by the agreement unless the trade union has established at the time it entered into or became bound by the agreement that not less than fifty-five per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit were members of such trade union, and any such provision entered into contrary to this subsection is void.

8(6)Subsection (5) does not apply

(a) where the trade union has been certified as the bargaining agent of the employees of the employer in the bargaining unit,

(b) where the trade union has been a party to or bound by a collective agreement with the employer for at least one year,

(c) where the employer becomes a member of an employers’ organization that has entered into a collective agreement with the trade union or council of trade unions containing such a provision and agrees with the trade union or council of trade unions to be bound by such agreement, or

(d) where the employer and his employees in the bargaining unit are engaged in the construction industry.

8(7)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where the parties to a collective agreement have included in it any of the provisions permitted by subsection (1), any of such provisions may be continued in effect during the period when the parties are bargaining with a view to the renewal or revision of the agreement or to the making of a new agreement.

8(8)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where the parties to a collective agreement have included in it any of the provisions permitted by subsection (1) and the employer who was a party to or was bound by the agreement sells his business within the meaning of [section 60](#sec60_smooth), any of such provisions, as were included in the collective agreement, may be continued in effect during the period when the person to whom the business was sold and the trade union or council of trade unions, that is the bargaining agent for his employees in the appropriate bargaining unit by reason of the sale, bargain with a view to the making of a new agreement.

8(9)Nothing in subsection (7) or (8) affects the application of [section 35](#sec35_smooth).

8(10)No employer, and no person acting on behalf of an employer, shall discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee within the meaning of this section when he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members or when he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership, subject to subsection (4), was denied, suspended or terminated for a reason specified in subsection (3).

8(11)Where a dispute arises as a result of a provision in a collective agreement permitted by subsection (1), the employer’s obligation to discharge an employee is arbitrable under the terms of that collective agreement.

Certification of bargaining agent

10(1)A trade union claiming to have as members in good standing a majority of employees of one or more employers in a unit that is appropriate for collective bargaining may, subject to the rules of the Board, make application to the Board to be certified as bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.

10(2)Where no collective agreement is in force and no bargaining agent has been certified under this Act for the unit, an application may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), be made at any time for certification as bargaining agent of the employees in the unit.

10(3)Where no collective agreement is in force but a bargaining agent has been certified under this Act for the unit and where no declaration has been made by the Board that the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit, another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit determined in the certificate only after the expiry of twelve months from the date of the certificate, or only after the expiry of twelve months from the date of the termination of a collective agreement when [section 21](#sec21_smooth) applies.

10(4)Where no collective agreement is in force and where an employer and a trade union have entered into a recognition agreement and where the Board has not made a declaration under [section 29](#sec29_smooth), another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the recognition agreement only after the expiry of twelve months from the date that the recognition agreement was entered into.

10(5)Where a collective agreement for a term of not more than three years is in force, another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement only after the commencement of the last two months of its operation.

10(6)Where a collective agreement for a term of more than three years is in force, another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement only after the commencement of the thirty-fifth month of its operation and before the commencement of the thirty-seventh month of its operation and during the two-month period immediately preceding the end of each year that the agreement continues to operate thereafter or after the commencement of the last two months of its operation.

10(7)Where a collective agreement referred to in subsection (5) or (6) provides that it will continue to operate for a further term or successive terms if either party fails to give to the other notice of termination or of its desire to bargain with a view to the renewal or revision of the agreement or to the making of a new agreement, another trade union may, subject to [section 11](#sec11_smooth), apply to the Board for certification as bargaining agent of any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement during the further term or successive terms only during the last two months of each year that it so continues to operate or after the commencement of the last two months of its operation.

10(8)Where the Board is of the opinion that the employees in a unit or their employer, or both, would suffer substantial and irremediable damage or loss if it did not entertain an application under subsection (1) at a time other than as authorized in subsection (5), (6) or (7), and that it is not reasonable in the circumstances that the employees or the employer, as the case may be, should suffer that damage or loss, an application under this section may be made at any time.

13(1)Upon an application for certification as bargaining agent for employees in a unit, the Board shall determine whether the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining and the Board may before certification, if it deems it appropriate to do so, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit, and the Board may, before determining the unit, take such steps as it deems appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the wishes of the employees as to the appropriateness of the unit.

13(2)Upon an application for certification within subsection (1), any group of employees, who exercise technical skills or who are members of a craft by reason of which they are distinguishable from the other employees and commonly bargain separately and apart from other employees through a trade union that according to established trade union practice pertains to such skills or craft, shall be deemed by the Board to be a unit appropriate for collective bargaining if the application is made by a trade union pertaining to such skills or craft, and the Board may include in such unit persons who according to established trade union practice are commonly associated in their work and bargaining with such group; but the Board is not required to apply this subsection where the group of employees is included in a bargaining unit represented by another bargaining agent at the time the application is made, or where the group of employees is exercising a combination of technical skills or is required to perform the skills in whole or in part of more than one craft as part of a work crew or team, the other members of which are also required to perform in similar fashion.

13(3)Where the Board has certified a trade union as the bargaining agent for a unit of employees that comprises members of a fire department and other employees and where that bargaining agent makes an application to the Board for a separate certification for a unit of employees comprising only those members of a fire department, the members of the fire department shall be deemed to be a unit appropriate for collective bargaining.

14(1)When, pursuant to an application for certification under this Act by a trade union, the Board has determined that a unit of employees is appropriate for collective bargaining, the Board shall ascertain the number of employees in the bargaining unit at the date the application was made and the number of employees in the unit who were members of the trade union at such time as is determined under [paragraph 126(2)](#sec126subsec2_smooth)(e).

14(2)If the Board is satisfied that not less than forty per cent and not more than sixty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit are members in good standing of the trade union, the Board may direct that a representation vote be taken.

14(3)If, on the taking of a representation vote, more than fifty per cent of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in favour of the trade union, and, in other cases, if the Board is satisfied that more than sixty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit are members in good standing of the trade union, the Board shall certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees in the bargaining unit.

14(4)In determining the number of eligible voters for the purpose of subsection (3), employees who are absent from work during voting hours and who do not cast their ballots shall not be counted as eligible.

14(5)If, on any application to which this section refers, the Board is satisfied that more than fifty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit are members in good standing of the trade union, the Board may certify the trade union as bargaining agent without taking a representation vote.

15(1)Upon an application for certification, the trade union may request that a pre-hearing representation vote be taken.

15(2)Upon a request made under subsection (1), the Board may determine a voting constituency and, if it appears to the Board on an examination of the records of the trade union and the records of the employer that not less than forty per cent of the employees in the voting constituency were members of the trade union at the time the application was made, the Board may direct that a representation vote be taken among the employees in the voting constituency.

15(3)The Board may direct that the ballot box containing the ballots cast in a representation vote taken under subsection (2) be sealed and that the ballots not be counted until the parties have been given full opportunity to present evidence and make representations.

15(4)Where a representation vote has been taken under subsection (2), the Board shall determine the unit of employees that is appropriate for collective bargaining and, if it is satisfied that not less than forty per cent of the employees in such bargaining unit were members of the trade union at the time the application was made, the representation vote taken under subsection (2) has the same effect as a representation vote taken under [subsection 14(2)](#sec14subsec2_smooth).

Effect of certification

21(1)Where a trade union is certified under this Act as the bargaining agent of the employees in a unit,

(a) the trade union shall immediately replace any other bargaining agent of employees in the unit and shall have exclusive authority to bargain collectively on behalf of employees in the unit and to bind them by a collective agreement until the certification of the trade union in respect of employees in the unit is revoked, and

(b) if another trade union had previously been certified as bargaining agent in respect of employees in the unit, the certification of that trade union shall cease to operate and shall be deemed to be revoked in respect of such employees.

21(2)Where a trade union is certified under this Act as the bargaining agent of the employees in a unit, if at the time of certification a collective agreement that is binding on or that was entered into on behalf of the employees is in force, the trade union shall be substituted as a party to the agreement in place of the bargaining agent that is a party to the agreement on behalf of the employees in the unit.

21(3)Where a trade union is substituted as a party to a collective agreement under this section, the collective agreement, in so far as it applies to the employees in the unit for which the trade union was certified, notwithstanding anything in the agreement or in this Act, may be terminated

(a) at any time by the mutual consent of the parties,

(b) when the agreement provides for a term of one year, at any time after the agreement has been in force for ten months, if written notice is given by the trade union,

(c) when the agreement provides for a term of more than one year and less than the term in paragraph (d) and the agreement has been in force for one year, at the end of the second year or at the end of the term, if two months’ notice in writing is given by the trade union preceding the anniversary date of the agreement or before the end of the term,

(d) when the agreement provides for a term of three years or more, at the end of the second or subsequent year that the agreement has been in force or at the end of the term, if two months’ notice in writing is given by the trade union preceding the anniversary date of the agreement or before the end of the term, or

(e) when the agreement provides for the continuation of the agreement from year to year, and the agreement has been in force for ten months, at the end of the first or subsequent year, if two months’ notice in writing is given by the trade union preceding the anniversary date of the agreement.

21(4)Where the Board is satisfied that consent should be given to the termination of a collective agreement under subsection (3) at a time other than as authorized, the Board may consent to earlier termination.

21(5)Where a trade union is substituted as a party to a collective agreement under this section and the collective agreement is terminated under this section, the trade union, may at any time serve written notice on the employer to commence collective bargaining and a notice given has the effect of a notice given under [section 32](#sec32_smooth).

21(6)Where, after the date a trade union or council of trade unions becomes entitled to apply for certification under [subsections 10(5)](#sec10subsec5_smooth) to [(7)](#sec10subsec7_smooth) or to apply for a declaration of termination of bargaining rights under [subsection 23(2)](#sec23subsec2_smooth), a trade union or council of trade unions terminates a collective agreement by mutual consent under subsection (3), an application may be made under [subsection 10(3)](#sec10subsec3_smooth) or under [subsection 23(1)](#sec23subsec1_smooth) and, notwithstanding the condition expressed in [section 10](#sec10_smooth), [11](#sec11_smooth), [23](#sec23_smooth) or [30](#sec30_smooth) with respect to an expiry date following the termination of an agreement under [section 21](#sec21_smooth), the condition shall not apply to the application.

Decertification – collective agreement

23(1)Where a trade union does not make a collective agreement with the employer within one year after its certification or within one year after the date of the termination of a collective agreement when [section 21](#sec21_smooth) applies, any of the employees in the bargaining unit determined in the certificate may, subject to [section 30](#sec30_smooth), apply to the Board for a declaration that the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit.

23(2)Any of the employees in the bargaining unit defined in a collective agreement may, subject to [section 30](#sec30_smooth), apply to the Board for a declaration that the trade union or council of trade unions no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit,

(a) when a collective agreement for a term of not more than three years is in force, only after the commencement of the last two months of its operation;

(b) when a collective agreement for a term of more than three years is in force, only after the commencement of the thirty-fifth month of its operation and before the commencement of the thirty-seventh month of its operation and during the two-month period immediately preceding the end of each year that the agreement continues to operate thereafter or after the commencement of the last two months of its operation;

(c) when a collective agreement referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) provides that it will continue to operate for any further term or successive terms if either party fails to give to the other notice of termination or of its desire to bargain with a view to the renewal or revision of the agreement or to the making of a new agreement, only during the last two months of each year that the agreement continues to operate, or after the commencement of the last two months of its operation.

23(3)Upon an application under subsection (1) or (2), the Board shall ascertain the number of employees in the bargaining unit at the date the application was made and, if satisfied that the application is supported by or has the voluntary support of not less than forty per cent of the employees in the bargaining unit at such time as is determined under [paragraph 126(2)](#sec126subsec2_smooth)(e) the Board shall, by a representation vote, satisfy itself whether a majority of the employees desire that the right of the trade union or council of trade unions to bargain on their behalf be terminated.

23(4)Where, on the taking of the representation vote under subsection (3), more than fifty per cent of the ballots of all those eligible to vote are cast in opposition to the trade union or council of trade unions, the Board shall declare that the trade union or council of trade unions that was certified or that was or is a party to the collective agreement, as the case may be, no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit.

23(5)In determining the number of eligible voters for the purpose of subsection (4), employees who are absent from work during voting hours and who do not cast their ballots shall not be counted as eligible.

23(6)An application under subsection (1) or (2) may be made by the employer and subsections (1) to (5) apply mutatis mutandis, if, in the application of subsection (3), the Board is satisfied that a substantial question exists as to whether the trade union or council of trade unions is supported by or has the voluntary support of the majority of the employees in the unit.

23(7)An application under subsection (1) or (2) may be made by another trade union or council of trade unions representing any of the employees in the bargaining unit described in the certification or in the collective agreement and subsections (1) to (5) apply mutatis mutandis.

23(8)Where the Board is of the opinion that the employees in a unit or their employer, or both, would suffer substantial and irremediable damage or loss if it did not entertain an application made by or on behalf of those employees or that employer under subsection (1) or (2), and that it is not reasonable in the circumstances that the employees or that the employer, as the case may be, should suffer that damage or loss, an application under this section may be made at any time.

23(9)An application under subsection (6) does not affect any obligation of the employer to bargain collectively under the provisions of this Act, but the Board, pending disposition of the application or on disposition, may extend any time limits applicable to collective bargaining under this Act as the circumstances may require.

29(1)Where an employer and a trade union or council of trade unions that has not been certified as the bargaining agent for a bargaining unit of employees of the employer enter into a collective agreement, or a recognition agreement, the Board may, upon the application of any of the employees in the bargaining unit, or of another trade union or council of trade unions representing any of the employees in the bargaining unit, during the first year of the period of time that the first collective agreement between them is in operation or, if no collective agreement has been entered into, within one year from the signing of such recognition agreement, declare that the trade union or council of trade unions was not, at the time the agreement was entered into, entitled to represent the employees in the bargaining unit.

29(2)Before disposing of an application under subsection (1), the Board may make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries, including the holding of hearings, as it deems necessary or take or supervise the taking of such votes as it deems expedient to direct and the Board may prescribe the nature of the evidence to be furnished to the Board.

29(3)On an application made under subsection (1), the onus of establishing that the trade union or council of trade unions was entitled to represent the employees in the bargaining unit at the time the agreement was entered into rests on the parties to the agreement.

29(4)Upon the Board making a declaration under subsection (1), the trade union or council of trade unions forthwith ceases to represent the employees in the defined bargaining unit in the recognition agreement or collective agreement and any collective agreement or recognition agreement in operation between the trade union or council of trade unions and the employer ceases to operate forthwith in respect of the employees affected by the declaration.

(b) thirty days have elapsed after the Minister has released to the parties a notice that he does not deem it advisable to appoint a conciliation board, or

(c) six months have elapsed after the Minister has released to the parties a notice of a report of the conciliation officer or mediator that the differences between the parties concerning the terms of a collective agreement have been settled,

as the case may be.

30(2)Where notice has been given under [section 33](#sec33_smooth) with a view to the renewal or revision of a collective agreement then in operation or to the making of a new agreement and the Minister has appointed a conciliation officer or appointed a mediator under [section 70](#sec70_smooth), no application for a declaration that the trade union or council of trade unions that was a party to the collective agreement no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit as defined in the agreement shall be made after the date when the agreement ceased to operate or the date when the Minister appointed the conciliation officer or mediator, whichever is later, unless, following the appointment of the conciliation officer or mediator, if no collective agreement has been made,

30(3)Where a trade union has given notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth) with the view to making an agreement and the employees in the bargaining unit on whose behalf the trade union was certified as bargaining agent thereafter engage in a lawful strike or the employer lawfully locks-out such employees, no application for a declaration that the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit determined in the certificate shall be made

(a) until six months have elapsed after the strike or lock-out commenced, or

Notice to commence collective bargaining – no collective agreement

32(1)Where the Board has under this Act certified a trade union as a bargaining agent of employees in a unit and no collective agreement with their employer binding on or entered into on behalf of employees in the unit, is in force,

(a) the bargaining agent may, on behalf of the employees in the unit, by notice in writing, require the employer to commence collective bargaining, or

(b) the employer or an employers’ organization representing the employer, may, by notice in writing, require the bargaining agent to commence collective bargaining,

with a view to the conclusion of a collective agreement.

32(2)Where a notice is given under subsection (1), the employer, upon written request of the bargaining agent, shall within a reasonable time, not exceeding the time prescribed in [section 34](#sec34_smooth), furnish to the bargaining agent a statement in writing of the classifications of employees not excluded by the certification order setting out the numbers of persons and rates of pay within each classification or, in the absence of such classifications, a list of all employees within the bargaining unit setting out the name and rate of pay of each such employee.

1971, c.9, s.33

Notice to commence collective bargaining – collective agreement in force

33(1)Either party to a collective agreement may, within the period of the ninetieth and the thirtieth day before the expiry date of the agreement, give notice in writing to the other party of its desire to bargain with a view to the renewal or revision of the agreement then in operation or to the making of a new agreement.

33(2)Where the provisions of a collective agreement relating to its termination or renewal or revision prescribe a period of notice that is longer than the period required under subsection (1), a notice, if given by a party to the agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof, shall be deemed a compliance with subsection (1).

33(3)Upon an application being made by or on behalf of employees affected by a collective agreement that has been renewed, revised, or replaced by a new collective agreement upon less than the notice prescribed in subsection (1), the Board may require the parties to the new agreement, or any of them, to show cause why a trade union or council of trade unions that is not a party to the new agreement should not be permitted to apply to be certified as the bargaining agent for the employees affected in place of the trade union or council of trade unions that is a party to the agreement and the Board, notwithstanding anything in this Act, may make such order with respect to the matter as it may deem just and reasonable, including permitting the trade union or council of trade unions that is not a party to the agreement to apply to be certified as the bargaining agent for the employees in the bargaining unit and the cancellation of the renewed, revised, or new agreement.

33(4)Where notice is given by or to an employers’ organization that has a collective agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions, it shall be deemed to be a notice given by or to each member of the employers’ organization who is bound by the agreement or who has ceased to be a member of the employers’ organization but has not notified the trade union or council of trade unions in writing that he has ceased to be a member.

33(5)Where notice is given by or to a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, that has a collective agreement with an employer or employers’ organization, it shall be deemed to be a notice given by or to each member or affiliate of the council of trade unions that is bound by the agreement or that has ceased to be a member or affiliate of the council of trade unions but has not notified the employer or employers’ organization in writing that it has ceased to be a member or affiliate.

34(1)Where notice to commence collective bargaining is given under [section 32](#sec32_smooth), the certified bargaining agent and the employer, or an employers’ organization representing the employer shall, without delay, but in any case within twenty days after the notice was given, or such further time as the parties may agree, meet and commence or cause authorized representatives on their behalf to meet and commence to bargain collectively with one another and shall make every reasonable effort to conclude a collective agreement.

34(2)Where a party to a collective agreement gives notice under [section 33](#sec33_smooth) to the other party to the agreement, the parties shall, without delay, but in any case within twenty days after the notice was given, or such further time as the parties may agree upon, meet and commence or cause authorized representatives on their behalf to meet and commence to bargain collectively and make every reasonable effort to conclude a renewal or revision of the agreement or a new agreement.

34(3)Where collective bargaining is substantially entered into under subsection (1) or (2), a party so bargaining collectively shall not discontinue, or withdraw from, the collective bargaining on the ground that no notice, or improper or insufficient notice, has been given under [section 32](#sec32_smooth) or [33](#sec33_smooth).

34(4)Where an employers’ organization commences to bargain with a trade union or council of trade unions, it shall deliver to the trade union or council of trade unions, and to each employer therein named, a list of the names of the employers on whose behalf it is bargaining and, in default of so doing, it shall be deemed to bargain for all members of the employers’ organization for whose employees the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to bargain and to make a collective agreement at that time, except an employer, who, either by himself or through the employers’ organization, has, within fourteen days of the commencement of bargaining, notified the trade union or council of trade unions in writing that the employers’ organization is not authorized to bargain collectively on behalf of the employer named in the notification.

34(5)Where a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, commences to bargain with an employer or an employers’ organization, it shall deliver to the employer or employers’ organization, and to each trade union therein named, a list of the names of the trade unions on whose behalf it is bargaining and, in default of so doing, it shall be deemed to bargain for all members or affiliates of the council of trade unions and for all employees for whom the respective trade unions are entitled to bargain and to make a collective agreement at that time with the employer or the employers’ organization, except a trade union that, either by itself or through the council of trade unions, has, within fourteen days of the date of the commencement of bargaining, notified the employer or employers’ organization in writing that the council of trade unions is not authorized to bargain collectively on behalf of the trade union named in the notification.

34(6)Where a list is delivered or a notification given under subsection (4) or (5), a copy thereof shall be delivered or given to the Board within the time prescribed and, on default, the Board may by order require the delivery of a copy of the list or of the notification.

35(1)Where a trade union or council of trade unions has applied for certification and notice thereof from the Board has been received by the employer or employers’ organization, no employer or employers’ organization shall, except with the consent of the trade union or council of trade unions, alter the rights, privileges or duty of the employer or the employee until

(a) the trade union has given notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth), in which case subsection (2) applies, or

(b) the application for certification by the trade union or council of trade unions is dismissed or terminated by the Board or withdrawn by the trade union or council of trade unions.

35(2)Where notice has been given under [section 32](#sec32_smooth) or [33](#sec33_smooth) and no collective agreement is in operation, no employer or employers’ organization shall, except with the consent of the trade union or council of trade unions, alter the rates of wages or any other term or condition of employment or any right, privilege or duty, of the employer, the employers’ organization, the trade union, the council of trade unions, or the employees, and no trade union or council of trade unions shall, except with the consent of the employer or employers’ organization, alter any term or condition of employment or any right, privilege or duty of the employer, the employers’ organization, the trade union, the council of trade unions, or the employees until a collective agreement or a renewal or revision of the agreement or a new agreement has been concluded or one of the following conditions has been met:

(a) until a party has requested the Minister to instruct a conciliation officer to confer with the parties and seven days have elapsed from the date on which the Minister has released to the parties a notice under [subsection 36(3)](#sec36subsec3_smooth) that he does not deem it advisable to appoint a conciliation officer or to appoint a mediator under [section 70](#sec70_smooth),

(b) until, where the Minister has appointed a conciliation officer or a mediator to confer with the parties, fourteen days have elapsed after the Minister has released to the parties a notice that he does not deem it advisable to appoint a conciliation board,

(c) until, where the Minister has appointed a conciliation board, fourteen days have elapsed after the Minister has released to the parties the report of the conciliation board, or

(d) until the right of the trade union or council of trade unions to represent the employees has been terminated,

whichever occurs first.

35(3)Where notice has been given under [section 33](#sec33_smooth) and no collective agreement is in operation, any difference between the parties as to whether or not subsection (2) of this section was complied with may be referred to arbitration by either of the parties as if the collective agreement was still in operation with the reference made thereunder and [section 55](#sec55_smooth) applies mutatis mutandis thereto.

35(4)Where a violation of this section is alleged and the matter has not been referred to arbitration under subsection (3), either of the parties may make an application to the Board and, where the Board determines upon hearing the application that this section has been violated, the Board may order any party to comply with the terms and conditions of employment or to cease doing anything that constitutes a violation of this section.

(b) collective bargaining has commenced,

and either party thereto requests the Minister in writing to instruct a conciliation officer to confer with the parties thereto to assist them to conclude a collective agreement or a renewal or revision thereof and such request is accompanied by a statement of the difficulties, if any, that have been encountered before the commencement or in the course of the collective bargaining, or in any other case in which in the opinion of the Minister it is advisable so to do, the Minister may appoint one or more conciliation officers to confer with the parties engaged in collective bargaining.

36(2)Where a conciliation officer fails to bring about an agreement between parties engaged in collective bargaining, or in any other case where in the opinion of the Minister a conciliation board should be appointed to endeavour to bring about agreement between parties to a dispute, the Minister may appoint a conciliation board for such purpose.

36(3)Where the Minister receives a request to appoint a conciliation officer under subsection (1), he shall, within seven days of receiving the request, send to the parties a notice as to whether he deems it advisable to appoint a conciliation officer.

36(4)Where the Minister has received the report of a conciliation officer appointed under subsection (1) he may consult with the parties and, within fifteen days after receiving that report, he shall send to the parties a notice as to whether he deems it advisable to appoint a conciliation board.

36(7)Where an appointment is made by the Minister under subsection (6), the appointment has the effect of an appointment made under subsection (1) for the purposes of this Act.

36(8)Where the Minister deems it advisable not to make an appointment under subsection (6), the notification is not a notice within the meaning of subsection (3) for the purposes of this Act.

36(9)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where the Minister has appointed a conciliation officer or a mediator under this section and the parties have failed to enter into a collective agreement within fifteen months from the date of such appointment, the Minister may, upon the joint request of the parties, again appoint a conciliation officer or a mediator to confer with the parties and endeavour to effect a collective agreement, and, upon such appointment being made, all provisions of this Act relating to or regulating a first appointment of a conciliation officer, mediator, or conciliation board appointed under this section and all provisions prescribing any such appointment as a requirement or condition, or prescribing the effect of any such appointment under this Act, shall apply mutatis mutandis, but such appointment is not a bar to an application for certification or for a declaration that the trade union or council of trade unions no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit.

36(10)Notwithstanding the failure of a trade union to give written notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth), or the failure of either party to give written notice under [section 33](#sec33_smooth), where the parties have met and bargained, the Minister may appoint a conciliation officer, a mediator, or a conciliation board in any case to which subsection (1), (2), (5) or (6) applies.

40(1)Where a trade union applies for certification as bargaining agent of the employees of an employer, the Board shall determine the unit of employees that is appropriate for collective bargaining by reference to a geographic area and it shall not confine the unit to a particular project unless satisfied that the circumstances warrant a unit so confined.

40(2)In determining the appropriate unit on an application to which subsection (1) applies, the Board may designate the whole or any part of the Province as a geographic area and may limit the unit to a designated geographic area.

40(3)In determining whether a trade union to which subsection (1) applies has met the requirements of [subsection 14(1)](#sec14subsec1_smooth), the Board need not have regard to any increase in the number of employees in the bargaining unit after the date the application was made.

40(4)Where application to which subsection (1) applies is made, the application is, except as provided in subsection (5), subject to the provisions of this Act and any rules prescribed by the Board requiring notice on an application.

40(5)The Board, subject to such rules as it may prescribe, in respect to any application to which subsection (1) applies, may certify an applicant or dismiss the application without a hearing and without notice or without a hearing on such notice as may be required under the rules.

40(6)Where a trade union makes an application for certification to which subsection (1) applies, the Board shall forthwith determine,

(a) whether or not the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining, and

(b) whether or not, if the unit is an appropriate unit, a majority of employees in the unit are members in good standing of the trade union or have selected the trade union to be bargaining agent on their behalf.

40(7)For the purposes of determining the percentage of employees in the appropriate unit who are members in good standing of the trade union under subsection (6), the Board may require the employer to file with the Board a list of employees verified by statutory declaration together with any information that the Board may require in respect of the employees.

40(8)Where the Board determines, in respect of an application to which subsection (1) applies, that the unit is appropriate for collective bargaining and that the majority of employees in the unit are members in good standing or have selected the trade union to be bargaining agent, the Board shall forthwith certify the trade union as the bargaining agent of the employees of the employer in the appropriate unit and the order of certification shall be an order under [section 14](#sec14_smooth).

40(9)Where, on an application to which subsection (1) applies, the Board is satisfied that the trade union is not entitled to be certified, the Board shall dismiss the application and may, in the same order or a subsequent order, establish the length of time before the trade union may make another application on behalf of the same unit of employees.

40(10)Where the Board issues an order under subsection (9) dismissing an application to which this section applies without a hearing pursuant to subsection (5) and the applicant trade union requests a hearing, the Board shall hold a hearing and may revoke the order and proceed under this section.

40(11)Where the Board certifies a trade union on an application to which this section applies without notice or without a hearing pursuant to subsection (5), and the employer or another trade union requests a hearing, the Board shall hold a hearing and may revoke or vary the order made under subsection (8).

40(12)A request made under subsection (10) or (11) for a hearing shall be made within ten days after the order or certification is issued subject to extension by the Board.

46(1)Upon an application for accreditation under [section 44](#sec44_smooth), the Board shall ascertain

(a) the number of employers in the unit of employers on the date of the application who have within one year prior to such date had employees in their employ for whom the trade union or council of trade unions has bargaining rights in the geographic area and sector determined by the Board to be appropriate,

(b) the number of employers in paragraph (a), represented by the employers’ organization on the date of the application, and

(c) the number of employees of employers in paragraph (a) on the payroll of each such employer for the weekly payroll period immediately preceding the date of the application or, if in the opinion of the Board such payroll period is unsatisfactory for any one or more of the employers in paragraph (a), such other weekly payroll period for any one or more of such employers as the Board considers advisable.

46(2)The Board, if satisfied

(a) that a majority of the employers in paragraph (1)(a) are represented by the employers’ organization, and

(b) that such majority of employers employed a majority of the employees in paragraph (1)(c)

shall, subject to subsection (3), accredit the employers’ organization as the bargaining agent of the employers in the unit of employers and for such other employers for whose employees the trade union or council of trade unions may, after the date of the making of the application, obtain bargaining rights through certification or voluntary recognition in recognition agreements in the appropriate geographic area and sector.

46(3)Before accrediting an employers’ organization under subsection (2), the Board shall satisfy itself that the employers’ organization is a properly constituted organization and that each of the employer members whom it represents has vested appropriate authority in the organization to enable it to discharge the responsibilities of an accredited bargaining agent.

46(4)Where the Board is of the opinion that appropriate authority has not been vested in the employers’ organization, the Board may postpone disposition of the application to enable employers represented by the organization to vest such additional or other authority in the organization as the Board considers necessary.

46(5)The Board shall not accredit any employers’ organization if any trade union or council of trade unions has participated in its formation, selection or administration or has contributed financial or other support to it.

47(1)Upon the accreditation of an employers’ organization, all rights, duties and obligations under this Act of employers for whom the accredited employers’ organization is or becomes the bargaining agent apply mutatis mutandis to the accredited employers’ organization.

47(2)Upon the accreditation of an employers’ organization, any collective agreement in operation between the trade union or council of trade unions and any employer in [paragraph 46(1)](#sec46subsec1_smooth)(a) is binding on the parties thereto only for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, regardless of any provision therein respecting its renewal or revision.

47(3)When any collective agreement mentioned in subsection (2) ceases to operate, the employer shall thereupon be bound by any collective agreement then in existence between the trade union or council of trade unions and the accredited employers’ organization or subsequently entered into by such parties.

47(4)Where, after the date of the making of an application for accreditation, a trade union or council of trade unions obtains bargaining rights for the employee of an employer through certification or voluntary recognition in a recognition agreement, that employer is bound by any collective agreement in existence at the time of the certification or voluntary recognition between the trade union or council of trade unions and the applicant employers’ organization or subsequently entered into by the parties.

47(5)A collective agreement between a trade union or council of trade unions and an employer who, but for the one-year requirement, would have been included in [paragraph 46(1)](#sec46subsec1_smooth)(a) is binding on the parties thereto only for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement regardless of any provisions therein respecting its renewal or revision.

47(6)When any collective agreement mentioned in subsection (5) ceases to operate, the employer shall thereupon be bound by any collective agreement then in existence between the trade union or council of trade unions and the accredited employers’ organization or subsequently entered into by such parties.

47(7)Where, under the provisions of this section, an employer becomes bound by a collective agreement between a trade union or council of trade unions and an accredited employers’ organization after the agreement has commenced to operate, the agreement ceases to be binding on the employer in accordance with the terms thereof, notwithstanding [subsection 57(1)](#sec57subsec1_smooth).

49(1)Where an accredited employers’ organization does not make a collective agreement with the trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, within one year after its accreditation, any of the employers in the unit of employers determined in the accreditation certificate may apply at any time to the Board for a declaration that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the bargaining unit.

49(2)Any of the employers in the bargaining unit defined in a collective agreement between an accredited employers’ organization and a trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, may apply to the Board only during the last two months of the operation of the agreement for a declaration that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the unit of employers.

49(3)Upon an application under subsection (1) or (2), the Board shall ascertain

(a) the number of employers in the unit of employers on the date of the application,

(b) the number of employers in the unit of employers who, within the two-month period immediately preceding the date of making of the application, have voluntarily signified in writing that they no longer wish to be represented by the accredited employers’ organization, and

(c) the number of employees affected by the application of employers in the unit of employers on the payroll of each such employer for the weekly payroll period immediately preceding the date of the application or, if in the opinion of the Board such payroll period is unsatisfactory for any one or more of the employers in paragraph (a), such other weekly payroll period for any one or more of such employers as the Board considers advisable.

49(4)If the Board, on an application made under subsection (1) or (2) is satisfied

(a) that a majority of the employers in paragraph (3)(a) has voluntarily signified in writing that they no longer wish to be represented by the accredited employers’ organization, and

(b) that such majority of employers employed a majority of the employees in paragraph (3)(c)

the Board shall declare that the employers’ organization that was accredited or that was or is a party to the collective agreement, as the case may be, no longer represents the employers in the unit of employers.

49(5)Where an accredited employers’ organization does not give notice to commence to bargain within thirty days after it becomes entitled so to do following its accreditation, or where it fails to give notice under [section 33](#sec33_smooth), and no such notice is given by the trade union or council of trade unions, any of the employers in the unit of employers determined in the accreditation certificate or any of the employees in the unit or a trade union or council of trade unions affected by the accreditation may, with the consent of the Board, apply for a declaration that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the bargaining unit and the Board, upon the application, may, upon inquiry, declare that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the bargaining unit.

49(6)Where an accredited employers’ organization that has given notice to commence to bargain within thirty days after it became entitled so to do following its accreditation or that has given notice under [section 33](#sec33_smooth), or that has received notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth) or [33](#sec33_smooth), fails to commence to bargain within ten days from the giving of the notice, or after having commenced to bargain, but before the Minister has appointed a conciliation officer or appointed a mediator under [section 70](#sec70_smooth), allows a period of thirty days to elapse during which it has not sought to bargain, any of the employers in the unit of employers determined in the accreditation certificate or any of the employees in the unit or a trade union or council of trade unions affected by the accreditation may, with the consent of the Board, apply for a declaration that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the bargaining unit and the Board, upon the application, may, upon inquiry, declare that the accredited employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the bargaining unit.

49(7)Upon an application under subsections (1) to (6), when the employers’ organization informs the Board that it does not desire to continue to represent the employers in the unit of employers, the Board may declare that the employers’ organization no longer represents the employers in the unit.

49(8)Upon the Board making a declaration under subsections (4) to (7) the employers’ organization ceases to be an accredited employers’ organization, and

(a) any collective agreement in operation between the trade union or council of trade unions and the employers’ organization that is binding upon the employers in the unit of employers ceases to operate forthwith,

(b) all rights, duties and obligations under this Act of the employers’ organization revert mutatis mutandis to the individual employers represented by the employers’ organization, and

(c) the trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, is entitled to give to any employer in the unit of employers a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement, and such notice has the same effect as a notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth).

49(9)The trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, and the accredited employers’ organization may for the purposes of this section agree in writing to an extension of the times prescribed in subsection (1), (5) or (6) in which event subsection (1), (5) or (6) applies from the elapse of the extended time.

49(10)An application under subsection (5) or (6) by a trade union or council of trade unions does not affect any obligation of the trade union or council of trade unions to bargain collectively under the provisions of this Act, but the Board, pending disposition of the application or on disposition, may extend any time limits applicable to collective bargaining under this Act as the circumstances may require.

(260, 10, '##### Settlement of grievances

55(1)Every collective agreement shall provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration or otherwise, without stoppage of work, of all differences between the parties to, or persons bound by, the agreement or on whose behalf it was entered into, concerning its interpretation, application, administration or an alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable.

55(2)Where a collective agreement does not contain such a provision as is mentioned in subsection (1), it shall be deemed to contain the following provision:

“Where a difference arises between the parties relating to the interpretation, application or administration of this agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable, or where an allegation is made that this agreement has been violated, either of the parties may, after exhausting any grievance procedure established by this agreement, notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the difference or allegation to arbitration and the notice shall contain the name of the person appointed to the arbitration board by the party giving the notice. The party to whom the notice is given shall, within five days of receiving the notice, name the person whom it appoints to the arbitration board and shall advise the other party of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. The two appointees so selected shall, within five days of the appointment of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be the chairman. Where the party receiving the notice fails to appoint a member of the arbitration board, or where the two appointees of the parties fail to agree upon a chairman within the time limited, the Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour for New Brunswick, upon the request of a party to the agreement, shall appoint a member on behalf of the party failing to make an appointment, or shall appoint the third member, as the case may be, and, where the case requires, shall appoint both. The arbitration board shall hear and determine the difference or allegation and shall issue a decision and the decision is final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee or employer affected by it. The decision of a majority is the decision of the arbitration board, but, if there is no majority, the decision of the chairman shall be the decision of the arbitration board.”

55(3)The provisions of subsection (2) apply to arbitrations commenced after March 31, 1972 and to arbitrations commenced before subsection (2) comes into force and in respect of which the arbitrator or arbitration board has heard no evidence, notwithstanding that the collective agreement under which the arbitration was commenced was entered into before April 1, 1972.

55(4)Where, in the opinion of the Board, any part of the arbitration provisions in a collective bargaining agreement, including the method of appointment of the arbitrator or arbitration board, is inadequate, or the provisions set out in subsection (2) are unsuitable in any particular case, the Board, on the application of a party to the collective agreement, may modify any such provision in such manner as not to conflict with subsection (1), but, until so modified, the arbitration provision in the collective agreement or in subsection (2), as the case may be, applies.

55(5)Where a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, provides for a panel of arbitrators jointly appointed or nominated thereto by the parties, the parties may at any time, except with respect to an arbitrator who has been appointed or designated to an arbitration or except with respect to a board of arbitration that is constituted, where he or it has entered upon a hearing, remove, substitute or add the names of persons to the panel and may modify any such provision in such manner as not to conflict with subsection (1), but, until so modified, or modified pursuant to subsection (4), the arbitration provision in the collective agreement applies.

55(6)Where a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, provides for arbitration before a three member board, or is deemed to provide for such a board by virtue of subsection (2), the parties may at any time, except with respect to an arbitration board which is constituted, and has entered upon a hearing, substitute therefor a provision applicable for the term of the agreement or for the term mentioned in the substituted provision, for arbitration before a single arbitrator and the parties may appoint a person to be the arbitrator or provide for appointment from a panel of arbitrators, but until so modified, or modified pursuant to subsection (4), the arbitration provision in the collective agreement or deemed to be included therein by virtue of subsection (2) applies.

55(7)Subsection (5) applies mutatis mutandis to a provision made under subsection (6) for the appointment of a panel of arbitrators.

55(8)Notwithstanding that a collective agreement has expired, an arbitration provision in that collective agreement pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) shall continue in force after the expiration of the agreement, for the benefit of an employee in the bargaining unit who is dismissed by the employer, until such time as a lawful strike or lock-out occurs.

55.01(1)Notwithstanding the arbitration provisions in a collective agreement or deemed to be contained in a collective agreement under [subsection 55(2)](#sec55subsec2_smooth) but subject to subsection (2), a party to a collective agreement may, in writing, request that the Minister refer to an arbitrator any difference between the parties to, or persons bound by, the collective agreement or on whose behalf it was entered into, concerning its interpretation, application, administration or an alleged violation of the collective agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable.

55.01(2)A request under subsection (1) shall not be made

(a) unless the grievance procedure under the collective agreement has been exhausted or thirty days have elapsed from the time at which the grievance was first brought to the attention of the other party, whichever occurs first, or

(b) if the difference has been referred to arbitration under the collective agreement by the party who wishes to make the request under subsection (1) or the time, if any, stipulated in or permitted by the collective agreement for referring the difference to arbitration has expired.

55.01(3)At the time of the making of a request under subsection (1), the party making the request shall send a copy of the request to the other party to the difference.

55.01(4)Where a request under subsection (1) is received by the Minister, the Minister

(a) shall appoint an arbitrator to hear and determine the matter arising out of the difference,

(b) shall fix the day, not later than twenty-eight days after the day on which the difference was referred to the Minister, on which the hearing by the arbitrator will commence, and

(c) may, if one party so requests and the other party agrees, appoint a grievance mediator to assist the parties in settling the grievance before the hearing.

55.01(5)If a request or more than one request concerns several differences arising under the collective agreement, the Minister may, in the Minister’s discretion, appoint an arbitrator under paragraph (4)(a) to deal with all the differences raised in the request or requests.

55.01(6)If a grievance mediator is appointed under paragraph (4)(c), the grievance mediator shall, within ten days after the appointment or within such further time as the Minister may allow,

(a) inquire into the difference,

(b) endeavour to assist the parties in settling the difference, and

(c) report to the Minister on the results of the inquiry and the success of the settlement effort.

55.01(7)If a grievance mediator is not appointed under paragraph (4)(c), or if the parties are unable to settle the difference with the assistance of a grievance mediator appointed under paragraph (4)(c), the arbitrator appointed under paragraph (4)(a) shall

(a) proceed to hear and determine the matter arising out of the difference, and

(b) subject to subsection (8), issue to the parties and file with the Minister a decision within twenty-one days after the conclusion of the hearing.

55.01(8)If requested to do so by the parties to the difference, an arbitrator appointed under paragraph (4)(a) shall

(a) if possible, issue an oral decision within one day after the conclusion of the hearing, and

(b) issue to the parties and file with the Minister written reasons within twenty-one days after the conclusion of the hearing.

55.01(9)If the arbitrator does not issue a decision within the time referred to in paragraph (7)(b) or does not issue written reasons within the time referred to in paragraph (8)(b), the Minister may make such order as the Minister considers necessary to ensure that the decision or the written reasons will be issued without further undue delay.

55.01(10)The Minister may establish a list of approved arbitrators for the purpose of this section.

55.01(11)For the purpose of advising the Minister with respect to persons qualified to act as arbitrators and other matters related to arbitrations under this section, the Minister may appoint an advisory committee comprised of

(a) three members who, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of employers,

(b) three members who, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of employees, and

(c) one member who, in the opinion of the Minister, is not representative of either employers or employees, to be the chairperson of the advisory committee.

55.01(12)Where the Minister appoints an arbitrator under paragraph (4)(a), the parties to the difference shall each pay one-half of the remuneration and expenses of the arbitrator.

55.01(13)Where the Minister appoints an arbitrator under paragraph (4)(a), [subsection 74(2)](#sec74subsec2_smooth) and [sections 76](#sec76_smooth), [77](#sec77_smooth) and [78](#sec78_smooth) shall apply with the necessary modifications.

55.1(1)Every collective agreement shall contain provisions regarding technological change which, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(a) define technological change,

(b) require the employer to give reasonable advance notice of technological change to the bargaining agent, and

(c) describe the contents of the notice.

55.1(2)Where a collective agreement does not contain such provisions as are mentioned in subsection (1), it shall be deemed to contain the following provision:

“The parties, being unable to agree upon provisions to be included in this agreement regarding technological change, agree upon notice in writing given by one party to the other party to submit their differences to arbitration before an arbitration board for final and binding settlement, without stoppage of work. The notice shall contain the name of the person appointed to the arbitration board by the party giving the notice. The party to whom the notice is given shall, within five days of receiving the notice, name the person whom it appoints to the arbitration board and shall advise the other party of the name of its appointee to the arbitration board. The two appointees so selected shall, within five days of the appointment of the second of them, appoint a third person who shall be the chairman. Where the party receiving the notice fails to appoint a member of the arbitration board, or where the two appointees of the parties fail to agree upon a chairman within the time limited, the Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour for New Brunswick, upon the request of a party to the agreement, shall appoint a member on behalf of the party failing to make an appointment, or shall appoint the third member, as the case may be, and, where the case requires, shall appoint both. The arbitration board shall hear and determine the differences and shall issue a decision and the decision is final and binding upon the parties and upon any employee or employer affected by it. The decision of the majority is the decision of the arbitration board, but, if there is no majority, the decision of the chairman shall be the decision of the arbitration board.”

55.1(3)Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if a provision of a collective agreement expressly states that a benefit, privilege, right or obligation was agreed to in lieu of the application of this section.

55.1(4)Where a dispute has been submitted to arbitration in accordance with subsection (2), [sections 73](#sec73_smooth) and [74](#sec74_smooth), [subsections 75(1)](#sec75subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec75subsec2_smooth), [subsections 76(1)](#sec76subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec76subsec2_smooth), [subsections 77(1)](#sec77subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec77subsec2_smooth), and [subsections 79(4)](#sec79subsec4_smooth) to [(10)](#sec79subsec10_smooth) apply mutatis mutandis and [subsection 131(2)](#sec131subsec2_smooth) applies to the proceedings and award of the arbitration board as if the arbitration board were named in that subsection.

55.1(5)Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) do not apply to a collective agreement that is in effect on the day this section comes into force.

55.1(6)Subsection (5) does not apply after the day on which the collective agreement expires or after the day that is two years after the day this section comes into force, whichever occurs first.

55.1(7)For the purposes of subsections (5) and (6), “collective agreement” includes an arbitration award that is in effect but not incorporated into a collective agreement on the day this section comes into force.

55.1(8)This section does not apply to a collective agreement that is entered into in the construction industry.

56(1)There shall be only one collective agreement at a time between a trade union or council of trade unions and an employer or employers’ organization with respect to the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the collective agreement.

56(2)A collective agreement is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employer and upon the trade union that is a party to the agreement whether or not the trade union is certified and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement.

56(3)A collective agreement between an employers’ organization and a trade union or council of trade unions is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employers’ organization and each person who was a member of the employers’ organization at the time the agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the employers’ organization bargained with the trade union or council of trade unions as if it was made between each of such persons and the trade union or council of trade unions and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement and, if any such person ceases to be a member of the employers’ organization during the term of operation of the agreement, he shall, for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a like agreement with the trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be.

56(4)A collective agreement between a certified council of trade unions and an employer is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon each trade union that is a constituent union of such a council as if it had been made between each of such trade unions and the employer.

56(5)A collective agreement between a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, and an employer or an employers’ organization is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the council of trade unions and each trade union that was a member of or affiliated with the council of trade unions at the time the agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the council of trade unions bargained with the employer or employers’ organization as if it was made between each of such trade unions and the employer or employers’ organization, and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement, and, if any such trade union ceases to be a member of or affiliated with the council of trade unions during the term of operation of the agreement, it shall, for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a like agreement with the employer or employers’ organization, as the case may be.

57(1)Where a collective agreement does not provide for its term of operation or provides for its operation for an unspecified term or for a term of less than one year, it shall be deemed to provide for its operation for a term of one year from the date that it commenced to operate.

57(2)Where a collective agreement, or an arbitration award made under [section 79](#sec79_smooth) or [80](#sec80_smooth), or a conciliation board award made under [section 69](#sec69_smooth), does not specify a commencement date, the agreement or award shall be deemed to commence on the first day of the month next following the month in which the agreement is executed or the award is made, as the case may be, and a collective agreement incorporating any such award shall be deemed to commence on the date of the commencement of the award.

57(3)Notwithstanding subsection (2), the parties may, before or after a collective agreement has ceased to operate, agree to continue its operation or any of its provisions for a period of less than one year while they are bargaining for its renewal or revision or for a new agreement, but such continued operation does not bar an application for certification or for a declaration that the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit.

57(4)Where a collective agreement is for a term longer than one year, the agreement shall contain or be deemed to contain a provision for the termination of the agreement

(a) at any time after the first year, by consent of the parties to the agreement, or

(b) at the end of the final year of the term of the agreement, by not less than two months’ notice given in writing by either party to the agreement before the end of the final year of the term of the agreement.

57(5)Subject to subsection (4), a collective agreement shall not be terminated by the parties before it ceases to operate in accordance with its provisions or before it may be terminated under the provisions of this Act without the consent of the Board on the joint application of the parties.

57(6)Notwithstanding anything in this section, where an employer joins an employers’ organization, other than an accredited employers’ organization, that is a party to a collective agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions and he agrees with the trade union or council of trade unions to be bound by the collective agreement between the trade union or council of trade unions and the employers’ organization, the agreement ceases to be binding upon the employer and the trade union or council of trade unions at the same time as the agreement between the employers’ organization and the trade union or council of trade unions ceases to be binding.

57(7)Nothing in this section prevents the revision by consent of the parties at any time of any provision of a collective agreement other than a provision relating to the term of operation.

Transfer of union rights

58(1)Where a trade union or council of trade unions claims that by reason of a merger or amalgamation or a transfer of jurisdiction it is the successor of a trade union or council of trade unions that at the time of the merger, amalgamation or transfer of jurisdiction was the bargaining agent of a unit of employees of an employer and any question arises in respect of its right to act as the successor, the Board, in any proceeding before it or on the application of any person or trade union concerned, may declare that the successor has or has not, as the case may be, acquired the rights, privileges and duties under this Act of its predecessor, or the Board may dismiss the application.

58(2)Before issuing a declaration under subsection (1), the Board may make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries, including the holding of hearings, as it deems necessary, or take or supervise the taking of such votes as it deems expedient to direct, and the Board may prescribe the nature of the evidence to be furnished to the Board.

58(3)Where the Board makes an affirmative declaration under subsection (1), the successor shall for the purposes of this Act be conclusively presumed to have acquired the rights, privileges and duties of its predecessor, whether under a collective agreement or otherwise, and the employer, the successor and the employees concerned shall recognize such status in all respects.

59(1)Where an employers’ organization claims that by reason of a merger or amalgamation it is the successor of an employers’ organization, other than an accredited employers’ organization, that at the time of the merger or amalgamation represented employers in collective bargaining with a bargaining agent or as a party to a collective agreement, the Board, in any proceedings before it or on the application of any person or employer concerned, may declare that the successor has or has not, as the case may be, acquired the rights, privileges and duties under this Act of its predecessor, or the Board may dismiss the application.

59(2)Before issuing a declaration under subsection (1), the board may make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries, including the holding of hearings, as it deems necessary, or take or supervise the taking of such votes as it deems expedient to direct and the Board may prescribe the nature of the evidence to be furnished to the Board.

59(3)Where the Board makes an affirmative declaration under subsection (1), the successor shall, for the purposes of this Act, be conclusively presumed to have acquired the rights, privileges and duties of its predecessor, whether under a collective agreement or otherwise, and the trade union or council of trade unions, the successor and the employees concerned shall recognize such status in all respects.

60(1)In this section

“business” includes a part or parts thereof;(entreprise)

“sells” includes leases, transfers and any other manner of disposition, and “sold” and “sale” have corresponding meanings.(vend)

60(2)Where an employer who is bound by or is a party to a collective agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions sells his business, the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board otherwise declares, bound by the collective agreement as if he had been a party thereto and, where an employer sells his business while an application for certification or termination of bargaining rights to which he is a party is before the Board, the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board otherwise declares, the employer for the purposes of the application as if he were named as the employer in the application.

60(3)Where an employer on behalf of whose employees a trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, has been certified as bargaining agent or has given or is entitled to give notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth), sells his business, the trade union or council of trade unions continues, until the Board otherwise declares, to be the bargaining agent for the employees of the person to whom the business was sold in the like bargaining unit in that business, and the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to give to the person to whom the business was sold a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement and such notice has the same effect as a notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth).

60(4)Where a business was sold to a person and a trade union or council of trade unions was the bargaining agent of any of the employees in such business, or a trade union or council of trade unions is the bargaining agent of the employees in any business carried on by the person to whom the business was sold, and

(a) any question arises as to what constitutes the like bargaining unit referred to in subsection (3), or

(b) any person, trade union or council of trade unions claims that, by virtue of the operation of subsection (2) or (3), a conflict exists between the bargaining rights of the trade union or council of trade unions that represented the employees of the predecessor employer and the trade union or council of trade unions that represents the employees of the person to whom the business was sold, or between collective agreements,

the Board may, upon the application of any person, trade union or council of trade unions concerned,

(c) define the composition of the like bargaining unit referred to in subsection (3) with such modification, if any, as the Board deems necessary,

(d) amend, to such extent as the Board deems necessary, any bargaining unit in any certificate issued to any trade union or any bargaining unit defined in any collective agreement, and

(e) declare which collective agreement, if any, shall continue in force and to what extent it shall continue in force and which collective agreement, if any, shall terminate.

60(5)The Board may, upon the application of any person, trade union or council of trade unions concerned, made within ninety days after the successor employer referred to in subsection (2) becomes bound by the collective agreement, or within ninety days after the trade union or council of trade unions has given a notice under subsection (3), terminate the bargaining rights of the trade union or council of trade unions bound by the collective agreement or that has given notice, as the case may be, if, in the opinion of the Board, the person to whom the business was sold has changed its character so that it is substantially different from the business of the predecessor employer.

60(6)Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3), where a business was sold to a person who carries on one or more other businesses and a trade union or council of trade unions is the bargaining agent of the employees in any of the businesses and such person intermingles the employees of one of the businesses with those of another of the businesses, the Board may, upon the application of any person, trade union or council of trade unions concerned,

(a) declare that the person to whom the business was sold is no longer bound by the collective agreement referred to in subsection (2),

(b) determine whether the employees concerned constitute one or more appropriate bargaining units,

(c) declare which trade union, trade unions or council of trade unions, if any, shall be the bargaining agent or agents for the employees in such unit or units,

(d) amend, to such extent as the Board deems necessary, any certification issued to any trade union or any bargaining unit defined in any collective agreement, and

(e) declare which collective agreement, if any, shall continue in force and to what extent it shall continue in force and which collective agreement, if any, shall terminate.

60(7)Where a trade union or council of trade unions is declared to be the bargaining agent under subsection (6) and it is not already bound by a collective agreement with the successor employer with respect to the employees for whom it is declared to be the bargaining agent, it is entitled to give to the employer a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement, and such notice has the same effect as a notice under [section 32](#sec32_smooth).

60(8)Before disposing of any application under this section, the Board may make or cause to be made such examination of records or other inquiries, including the holding of hearings, as it deems necessary, or take or supervise the taking of such votes as it deems necessary, and the Board may prescribe the nature of the evidence to be furnished to the Board.

60(9)Where an application is made under this section, an employer is not required, notwithstanding that a notice has been given by a trade union or council of trade unions, to bargain with that trade union or council of trade unions concerning the employees to whom the application relates until the Board has disposed of the application and has declared which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, has the right to bargain with the employer on behalf of the employees concerned in the application.

60(10)For the purposes of [sections 10](#sec10_smooth), [11](#sec11_smooth), [23](#sec23_smooth), [24](#sec24_smooth), [30](#sec30_smooth) and [42](#sec42_smooth), a notice given by a trade union or council of trade unions under subsection (3) or a declaration made by the Board under subsection (6) has the same effect as a certification under [section 14](#sec14_smooth).

60(11)When under the [Local Governance Act](/en/nb/laws/stat/snb-2017-c-18/latest/snb-2017-c-18.html) or any other Act two or more local governments are amalgamated, the employees of those local governments shall be deemed to have been intermingled, and in such case or when, as a result of the decrease of the territorial limits of one local government related to an annexation to another local government, there is an intermingling of one or more employees of one local government with the employees of the other,

(a) the Board may exercise the like powers as it may exercise under subsections (6) and (8) with respect to the sale of a business under this section,

(b) the new or enlarged local government has the like rights and obligations as a person to whom a business is sold under this section and who intermingles the employees of one of his businesses with those of another of his businesses, and

(c) any trade union or council of trade unions concerned has the like rights and obligations as it would have in the case of the intermingling of employees in two or more businesses under this section.

60(12)Subject to subsection (11), when under the [Local Governance Act](/en/nb/laws/stat/snb-2017-c-18/latest/snb-2017-c-18.html) or any other Act a village or town is incorporated as a town or city, as the case may be, or the territorial limits of a local government are enlarged by an annexation or decreased, the local government created by the incorporation, annexation or decrease in territorial limits is, for the purposes of this Act, the same person as the local government that existed before the incorporation, annexation or decrease in territorial limits.

60(13)Where, on any application under this section or in any other proceeding before the Board, a question arises as to whether a business has been sold by one employer to another, the Board shall determine the question and its decision thereon is final and conclusive for the purposes of this Act.

60(14)This section does not apply in respect of the sale of business before April 1, 1972, and, where a question arises as to whether a business has been sold by one employer to another for purposes of the application of this subsection, the Board shall determine the question and its decision thereon is final and conclusive.

67(1)A conciliation board has the power of summoning before it any witnesses and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, or if they are persons entitled to affirm in civil matters, on affirmation, and orally or in writing, and to produce such documents and things as the conciliation board deems requisite to the full investigation and consideration of the matters referred to it.

67(2)A conciliation board has the same power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence as is vested in any court of record in civil cases.

67(3)Any member of a conciliation board may administer an oath or affirmation, and the conciliation board may receive and accept evidence on oath or affirmation, affidavit or otherwise as in its discretion the board may deem fit and proper, whether admissible as evidence in a court of law or not.

67(4)A conciliation board, or a member thereof, or any person who has been authorized for such purpose in writing by a conciliation board, may, without any other warrant than this section, at any time, enter a building, ship, vessel, factory, workshop, place or premises of any kind where work is being or has been done or commenced by employees or in which an employer carries on business or any matter or thing is taking place or has taken place, concerning the matters referred to the conciliation board, and may inspect and view any work, material, machinery, appliance or article therein, and interrogate any person in or upon any such place, matter or thing hereinbefore mentioned; and no person shall hinder or obstruct the board, member or any person authorized by the board, in the exercise of a power conferred by this subsection or refuse to answer an interrogation made.

69(1)Where a conciliation board has been appointed and at any time, before or after it has made its report, the parties so agree in writing, the recommendations of the conciliation board are binding on the parties and they shall give effect thereto.

69(2)An agreement to be bound by the recommendations of a conciliation board under subsection (1) is effective when filed with the Minister or when filed with the board for transmission to the Minister.

69(3)Where the Minister is requested to appoint a conciliation board, if all the parties bargaining collectively offer or undertake in writing to be bound by, and give effect to, the recommendations of the conciliation board, each of those parties is bound by, and shall give effect to, the recommendations of the conciliation board if it is appointed.

69(4)An award under this section may be retroactive to the date of appointment of a conciliation officer or mediator, or to such earlier or later date as may be fixed in the award of the conciliation board, as the case may be, but in no case shall the award be retroactive, where no collective agreement was in operation, to a day before the day on which notice to bargain collectively was given by either party, or, where a collective agreement was in operation, before the expiration date of the agreement or the expiration date of a provision therein subject to revision under the agreement.

69(5)Where the parties agree to be bound under this section by the report of a conciliation board before the board has reported, [subsection 77(2)](#sec77subsec2_smooth) and [subsections 79(4)](#sec79subsec4_smooth) to [(6)](#sec79subsec6_smooth) and [(8)](#sec79subsec8_smooth) to [(10)](#sec79subsec10_smooth) shall apply mutatis mutandis and [subsection 131(2)](#sec131subsec2_smooth) shall apply to the proceedings and the award of the conciliation board as if such board were named therein.

73(1)Where, in any arbitration proceeding under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth), an arbitrator appointed by the parties, or an arbitrator appointed by or deemed to be appointed by a party, or a chairman appointed by the arbitrators appointed by the parties or deemed to be appointed by them, refuses to act or is incapable of acting or dies, any party may serve the other party or the arbitrators, as the case may be, with a written notice to appoint an arbitrator or a chairman within the time, if any, specified in the collective agreement for filling the vacancy, or within seven days if no time or provision is so prescribed, and, on the failure of an appointment to be made within the required time, a request may be made under subsection (2).

73(2)Where there is failure to appoint an arbitrator or to constitute an arbitration board under a collective agreement or under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth), the Minister, upon the request of either party, may appoint the arbitrator or make such appointments as are necessary to constitute the arbitration board, as the case may be, and any person so appointed by the Minister shall be deemed to have been appointed in accordance with the collective agreement, the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth), or subsection (1).

73(3)Where the Minister has appointed an arbitrator or the chairman of an arbitration board under subsection (2), each of the parties shall pay one-half the remuneration and expenses of the person appointed, and, where the Minister has appointed a member of an arbitration board under subsection (2), on the failure of one of the parties to make an appointment, that party shall pay the remuneration and expenses of the person appointed.

73(3.1)Except where a collective agreement states that this subsection does not apply, an arbitrator or arbitration board may extend the time for the taking of any step in the grievance procedure under a collective agreement, notwithstanding the expiration of such time, where the arbitrator or arbitration board is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the extension and that the opposite party will not be substantially prejudiced by the extension.

73(3.2)Where a difference has been submitted to arbitration under a collective agreement or under the provisions of section 55 and a party to the arbitration complains to the Minister that the arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the case may be, has failed to render a decision within a reasonable time, the Minister may, after consulting the parties and the arbitrator or the arbitration board, issue whatever order he considers necessary in the circumstances to ensure that a decision will be rendered in the matter without further undue delay.

73(4)Where a vacancy is filled under subsection (1) or (2) and the vacancy occurred after the commencement of the hearings in an arbitration proceeding, the hearings need not be recommenced or repeated where a transcript has been taken, but, on request made by any party to the proceedings, or in any case where the arbitrator or arbitration board deems it advisable to do so, the arbitrator or the board may in its discretion rehear the matter in whole or in part.

75(1)Where a difference has been submitted to arbitration under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth), the arbitrator or the arbitration board shall proceed with and complete the arbitration as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the interest of the parties, and shall make an award within three months after the date of the appointment of the arbitrator or the constitution of the arbitration board, or within three months after the date of an appointment or a reconstitution of a board on the filling of a vacancy, but the time for making an award may, from time to time, be extended by agreement of the parties, whether the time for making the award has expired or not, and a failure to make an award within the time expressed or as extended shall not invalidate the proceedings or terminate the authority of the arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the case may be.

75(2)Subsection (1) applies mutatis mutandis to an arbitration in the construction industry but an award shall be made within five days from the termination of hearings, if such time is less than the time provided in subsection (1), subject, from time to time, to such extension as may be agreed upon by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, as the Minister may approve, whether the time for making the award has expired or not.

75(3)Notwithstanding that the term of a collective agreement has expired, the provisions thereof and of [sections 55](#sec55_smooth) and [55.01](#sec55.01_smooth) for the final settlement without stoppage of work by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences concerning the interpretation, application, administration or an alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable, continue in force after the expiry of the term, where a notice has been given under [section 33](#sec33_smooth), until the date when one of the conditions, whichever occurs first, prescribed in [subsection 91(2)](#sec91subsec2_smooth), for a strike or lock-out is met.

75(4)Nothing in subsection (3) shall be interpreted to preclude or affect the jurisdiction of an arbitrator or arbitration board to render an award, that might otherwise be rendered, in any matter that arose before the date mentioned in subsection (3).

76(1)The arbitrator or the arbitration board, as the case may be, in any proceeding under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth), has power

(a) to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence in the same manner as a court of record in civil cases, orally or in writing, and to produce such documents and do all other things that, during the proceedings, the arbitrator or arbitration board may require,

(b) to administer oaths and affirmations of witnesses,

(c) to enter any premises where work is being done or has been done or commenced by the employees, in which the employer carried on business, or where anything is taking place or has taken place concerning any of the differences submitted to him or it, and to inspect and view any work, material, machinery, appliance or article therein, and interrogate any person in the presence of the parties or their representatives respecting any such thing or any of such differences,

(d) to authorize any person to do any things that the arbitrator or arbitration board may do under paragraph (c) and report to the arbitrator or arbitration board thereon,

(e) to receive and accept any relevant evidence whether admissible in evidence in a court of law or not, and

76(3)The arbitrator or the arbitration board by his or its decision in a proceeding under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth) shall not alter, amend or change the terms of the collective agreement.

76(4)Notwithstanding anything in the collective agreement, where the arbitrator or the arbitration board in a proceeding under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth) determines that an employee has been discharged or otherwise disciplined by an employer for cause and the collective agreement does not contain a specific penalty for the infraction that is the subject matter of the arbitration, the arbitrator or the arbitration board may substitute such other penalty for the discharge or discipline as to the arbitrator or arbitration board seems just and reasonable in all the circumstances.

76(5)Notwithstanding anything in the agreement or in this Act, the arbitrator or the arbitration board in a proceeding under the provisions of [section 55](#sec55_smooth) may reserve jurisdiction on any matter of compensation or on any matter relating to the application of an award, and, with respect to any matter so reserved, the award shall be deemed not to have been made until a notification is received of settlement by the parties and incorporated in an award or a final disposition of the matter is made in an award.

79(1)Where an employer or employers’ organization and a bargaining agent have bargained collectively with a view to the making of a collective agreement, or the renewal or revision of an agreement or the making of a new agreement, but have failed to reach agreement, the parties may, by agreement in writing to be bound by an award, submit their differences to arbitration before an arbitrator or arbitration board.

79(2)An agreement to be bound by an award made under subsection (1) is effective when filed with the Minister.

79(3)On the filing of an agreement to arbitrate under subsection (1) or on submitting the difference to an arbitrator or an arbitration board under [subparagraph 36.1(5)](#sec36.1subsec5_smooth)(b)(ii), [subsections 55(2)](#sec55subsec2_smooth) to [(5)](#sec55subsec5_smooth), [section 73](#sec73_smooth) and [74](#sec74_smooth), [subsections 75(1)](#sec75subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec75subsec2_smooth), [subsections 76(1)](#sec76subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec76subsec2_smooth) and [subsections 77(1)](#sec77subsec1_smooth) and [(2)](#sec77subsec2_smooth) shall apply with the necessary modifications and [subsection 131(2)](#sec131subsec2_smooth) shall apply to the proceedings and award of the arbitrator or arbitration board as if the arbitrator or arbitration board were named therein.

79(4)The arbitrator or arbitration board appointed or constituted under this section shall endeavour to bring about a settlement of the differences between the bargaining agent and the employer and to formulate an agreement which, upon being entered into by the parties, shall be a collective agreement under this Act.

79(5)Where the arbitrator or arbitration board is unsuccessful in formulating an agreement satisfactory to both parties, and after considering the matters of difference together with any other matter considered necessarily incidental to a resolution of the matters of difference, the arbitrator or arbitration board shall render an award in respect thereto.

79(6)An award made under subsection (5) shall not include any matter to which the parties agreed under subsection (4) and shall, whenever possible, be made in a form

(a) susceptible of being

(i) read and interpreted with, or

(ii) annexed to and published with

any collective agreement dealing with other terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit in respect of which the award applies, and

(b) susceptible of enabling its incorporation into and implementation by directions or other instruments that may be required to be made or issued by the employer or employers’ organization or the bargaining agent in respect thereof.

79(7)An award under subsection (5) may be retroactive to a day prior to the day on and from which it becomes binding on the parties but in no case shall the award be retroactive, where no collective agreement was in operation, to a day before the day on which notice to bargain collectively was given by either party, or, where a collective agreement was in operation, before the expiration date of the agreement or the expiration date of a provision therein subject to revision under the agreement.

79(8)The arbitrator or arbitration board shall, in respect of every award made under subsection (5), determine and specify therein the term for which the award shall be operative and, in making its determination, he or it shall take into account,

(a) where a collective agreement applicable to the bargaining unit is in effect or has been entered into but is not yet in effect, the term of that collective agreement, and

(b) where no collective agreement applying to the bargaining unit has been entered into,

(i) the term of any previous agreement that applied to the bargaining unit, or

(ii) the term of any other collective agreement that to the arbitrator or arbitration board appears relevant,

but no award, in the absence of the application thereto of any criterion referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), shall be for a term of less than one year or more than three years from the day on and from which it becomes binding on the parties.

79(9)Where an award is made under subsection (5) and it appears to a party bound by the award that the arbitrator or arbitration board has failed to deal with any matter of difference, or that a term of the award requires clarification, such party may, within seven days after the release of the award, request the arbitrator or arbitration board to reconvene and, upon any such request, the arbitrator or arbitration board shall reconvene and deal with the matter of the request in the same manner as in the case of a difference between the parties initially before the arbitrator or arbitration board.

79(10)An award under subsection (5), subject to subsection (9), shall forthwith be incorporated into a collective agreement and [subsections 37(3)](#sec37subsec3_smooth), [(5)](#sec37subsec5_smooth) and [(6)](#sec37subsec6_smooth) apply mutatis mutandis and, until so incorporated, the award, subject to [subsection 57(2)](#sec57subsec2_smooth), shall have the effect of a collective agreement for the purposes of this Act.

83(1)Where a complaint is made by a trade union or council of trade unions, employer or employers’ organization that a trade union or council of trade unions, or an officer, representative or agent of a trade union or council of trade unions, was or is requiring an employer or an employers’ organization to assign particular work to persons in a particular trade union or in a particular trade, craft or class rather than to a person in another trade union or in another trade, craft or class, or that an employer was or is assigning work to persons in a particular trade union rather than to persons in another trade union, the Board may inquire into the complaint and direct what action, if any, the employer, the employers’ organization, the trade union or the council of trade unions or any officer, representative or agent of the trade union or council of trade unions or any person shall do or refrain from doing with respect to the assignment of work, and the Board may file a copy of the direction, exclusive of the reasons therefor, in the prescribed form, in The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, whereupon the direction shall be entered as a judgment or order of that Court and is enforceable as such.

83(2)The Board may, in any direction made under subsection (1), provide that it is binding on the parties for other jobs then in existence or undertaken in the future in such geographic area as the Board may deem advisable.

85(1)Where a trade union or a council of trade unions and an employer or an employers’ organization have made an arrangement to resolve any differences between them arising from the assignment of work and have designated a tribunal in accordance with [subsection 82(4)](#sec82subsec4_smooth), the Chief Executive Officer, or such other person as may be designated by the Chief Executive Officer, shall immediately notify the designated tribunal of a complaint under [section 83](#sec83_smooth) and the Board shall, upon such terms and conditions as it may fix, postpone an inquiry into the complaint until the difference has been referred and dealt with in accordance with such arrangement.

85(2)No complaint under [subsection 83(1)](#sec83subsec1_smooth) may be made by a trade union, council of trade unions, employer or employers’ organization that has entered into a collective agreement that contains a provision requiring the reference of any difference between them arising out of work assignment to a tribunal mutually selected by them with respect to any difference as to work assignment that can be resolved under the collective agreement, and such trade union, council of trade unions, employer or employers’ organization shall do or abstain from doing anything required of it by the decision of such tribunal, but nothing in this subsection shall, on a complaint being made, preclude the Board from prescribing the referral of a complaint in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement.

87(1)Where a complaint is made under [subsection 83(1)](#sec83subsec1_smooth) and the complainant alleges that a strike is imminent or is taking place by reason of the requirement as to the assignment of work, or by reason of the assignment of work, the Board may, after consulting any employer, employers’ organization, trade union or council of trade unions that in its opinion is concerned, make such interim order with respect to the assignment of the work as it in its discretion deems proper, and the Board from time to time may amend or vary such order as it in its discretion deems proper.

87(2)Where the Board has made an interim order or a direction under subsection (1), the person, employer, employers’ organization, trade union or council of trade unions and their officers, representatives or agents affected by the interim order or the direction may comply with it notwithstanding any provision of this Act or of any collective agreement relating to the assignment of the work to which the interim order or the direction relates, and the person, employer, employers’ organization, trade union or council of trade unions and their officers, representatives or agents so complying shall be deemed not to have violated any provision of this Act or of any collective agreement.

87(3)The Board may in an interim order or direction under subsection (1), or at any time after the making of such interim order or direction, direct any person, employee, employer, employers’ organization, trade union or council of trade unions and their officers, representatives or agents to cease and desist from doing anything intended or likely to interfere with the terms of an interim order or direction respecting the assignment of work.

87(4)The Board may file a copy of an interim order or direction made under this section, exclusive of the reasons therefor, in the prescribed form, in The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, whereupon the interim order or direction shall be entered as a judgment or order of that Court and is enforceable as such.

87(5)Where an interim order or a direction has been entered under subsection (4), it is enforceable by a person, employee, employer, employers’ organization, trade union or council of trade unions affected as a judgment or order of the Court on the day next after the day fixed for compliance in the interim order or direction.

87(6)A complaint in a case within subsection (1) may be withdrawn by the complainant only upon such terms and conditions as the Board may fix.

89(1)The Board may in its discretion, or at any time following the release of an order or direction under [section 83](#sec83_smooth) or [88](#sec88_smooth), alter the bargaining unit determined in a certificate or defined in a collective agreement as it deems proper, and the certificate or agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been altered accordingly.

89(2)The Board may, upon the application of any person, employer, trade union, council of trade unions or employers’ organization affected by a decision of a tribunal referred to in [section 85](#sec85_smooth), alter the bargaining unit determined in a certificate or defined in a collective agreement as it deems proper to enable the parties to conform to the decision of the tribunal, and the certificate or agreement, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been altered accordingly.

89(3)Where an employer is a party to or is bound by two or more collective agreements and it appears that the description of the bargaining unit in one of such agreements conflicts with the description of the bargaining unit in another of such agreements, the Board may, upon the application of the employer or any of the trade unions concerned, alter the description of the bargaining units in any such agreement as it deems proper, and the agreement or agreements shall be deemed to have been altered accordingly.

89(4)Before disposing of an application under this section, the Board may make such inquiry, require the production of such evidence and the doing of such things, or hold such representation votes, as it deems appropriate.

94(1)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, no employee shall strike until after a vote

(a) has been taken by the trade union or council of trade unions of the employees in the bargaining unit affected as to whether to strike or not to strike and the majority of such employees, as determined in this section, have voted in favour of a strike, or

(b) has been taken by the trade union or council of trade unions affected as to whether to strike or not to strike and a majority of the members affected have voted in favour of a strike and such majority in favour of a strike includes a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.

94(2)A vote taken under subsection (1) shall be taken by secret ballot cast in such a manner that a person expressing his choice cannot be identified with the choice expressed and the vote shall be conducted in such manner, whether by mail or otherwise, that those entitled to vote have ample opportunity to cast their ballots.

94(3)For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), no employee in the unit shall be counted as an employee unless he has been employed by the employer within the period of the three calendar months preceding the taking of such vote and, where the vote is taken on a working day otherwise than by mail, an employee who is absent from work on the day of the vote and who does not cast his ballot shall not be counted as an employee in determining the number of employees for the purposes of the paragraph.

94(4)Where a dispute arises with respect to subsection (1), (2) or (3), the vote may be continued or discontinued subject to reference of the dispute to the Board.

94(5)The Board on a reference under subsection (4) may revise the returns on the vote, or set aside the vote, or order a new vote, or make such other disposition as the circumstances require and the decision of the Board is final and binding on all parties.

94(6)The result of a vote when in favour of strike action does not bind a bargaining agent, a trade union, or an employee to that course of action, but no employee shall strike where a majority of the employees eligible to vote in the unit have voted against strike action.

95(1)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where two or more employers, or two or more employers who are members of an employers’ organization, other than an accredited employers’ organization, are engaged in the same dispute with employees in the same bargaining unit, no employer shall lock-out his employees until after a vote has been taken of all such employers with employees in the unit as to whether to lock-out or not to lock-out and a majority of such employers representing a majority of such employees of such employers have voted in favour of a lock-out.

95(2)Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where an accredited employers’ organization is authorized to bargain for or on behalf of an employer, no such employer shall lock-out his employees in the bargaining unit until after a vote has been taken by the accredited employers’ organization of all such employers as to whether to lock-out or not to lock-out and a majority of all such employers with employees in the bargaining unit, employing a majority of such employees of all such employers, have voted in favour of a lock-out.

95(3)A vote taken under subsection (1) or (2) shall be taken by secret ballot and the vote shall be conducted in such a manner, whether by mail or otherwise, that those eligible to vote have ample opportunity to cast their ballots.

95(4)For the purposes of subsection (1) or (2), no employee shall be deemed to be an employee unless he has been on the payroll of his employer for the weekly payroll period immediately preceding the day of the vote.

95(5)For the purposes of subsection (2), an employer who does not vote shall not be counted in determining the number of employers eligible to vote and his employees shall not be counted in determining the number of employees in the unit.

95(6)Where a dispute arises with respect to subsections (1) to (5), the vote may be continued or discontinued subject to reference of the dispute to the Board.

95(7)Where, on a reference under subsection (6), a question arises as to whether the payroll period prescribed in subsection (4) is or was satisfactory, the Board may fix such other weekly payroll period for any one or more of the employers as it deems satisfactory and the decision of the Board is final and binding on all parties.

95(8)The Board, on a reference under subsection (6), may revise the returns on the vote, or set aside the vote, or order a new vote, or make such other decision as the circumstances may require and the decision of the Board is final and binding on all parties.

95(9)The result of a vote when in favour of a lock-out does not bind an employers’ organization or an employer to that course of action, but no employer shall declare a lock-out where, in accordance with subsection (1) or (2), the requisite majority of employers employing the requisite majority of the employees of the employers, have voted against a lock-out.

Inquiry by Board

106(1)Where a complaint in writing is made to the Board alleging that an employer, employer’s organization, trade union, council of trade unions or any other person is doing or has done any act in violation of any provision of [sections 3](#sec3_smooth) to [9](#sec9_smooth), [50](#sec50_smooth) or [51](#sec51_smooth), the Chief Executive Officer shall immediately notify the alleged violator, and any other person or body affected by the complaint, by telephone and telegram of the making of the complaint.

106(2)Where a complaint is received under subsection (1) the Chief Executive Officer shall, on the advice of the Chairperson, either refer the complaint to the Board for inquiry or appoint a person to inquire into the complaint.

106(3)Where a complaint is referred under subsection (2) to the Board, the Board shall inquire forthwith into the matter.

106(4)A person appointed under subsection (2) to inquire into a matter shall endeavour to settle the matter complained of and shall report back to the Chairperson not later than fourteen days after the day on which the complaint was received by the Board.

106(5)Where a person appointed under subsection (2) has not been successful in settling the matter complained of the Board shall inquire forthwith into the matter.

106(6)Where, in the opinion of the Board, a complaint under subsection (1) is without merit, the Board may reject the complaint at any time.

106(7)Where in a complaint under this section it is alleged on an inquiry by the Board that

(a) any employer has discharged any employee or refused to employ or to continue to employ any person or threatened the dismissal of an employee contrary to [subsection 3(2)](#sec3subsec2_smooth), [(3)](#sec3subsec3_smooth) or [(4)](#sec3subsec4_smooth), or

(b) any union has intimidated, coerced, threatened or imposed a penalty on any employee or person contrary to [subsection 5(2)](#sec5subsec2_smooth) or [(3)](#sec5subsec3_smooth),

and the person complaining establishes a prima facie case against the employer or union, the burden of proving that the employer or union did not violate the provision lies with the employer or union, as the case may be.

106(8)Where upon inquiry the Board is satisfied that any employer, employer’s organization, trade union or council of trade unions or any other person is doing or has done any act in violation of any provision of [sections 3](#sec3_smooth) to [9](#sec9_smooth), [50](#sec50_smooth) or [51](#sec51_smooth), the Board

(a) shall make an order directing the employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions or other person to cease doing the act;

(b) may in the same order or in a subsequent order direct the employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions or other person to rectify the act;

(c) may in the same order or in a subsequent order direct the hiring or reinstatement of a person in employment with or without compensation, or the compensation of a person in lieu of hiring or reinstatement for loss of earnings and other employment benefits;

(d) may in the same order or in a subsequent order direct an employer found in violation of [subsection 3(3)](#sec3subsec3_smooth) not to increase or decrease wages, or alter a term or condition of employment, of the employees affected by the order for a period not exceeding thirty days without written permission from the Board, and may in a subsequent order direct the extension of any such direction for a further period not exceeding thirty days;

(e) may, where an employer or employers’ organization, or a trade union or council of trade unions, contravenes any provision of [sections 3](#sec3_smooth) to [9](#sec9_smooth) so that the true wishes of the employees are not likely to be ascertained, and, in the opinion of the Board, a trade union has membership support adequate for collective bargaining or such support has been obtained by virtue of an unfair labour practice, certify the trade union, or refuse to certify the trade union, as the case may be;

(f) may in the same order or in a subsequent order declare, where applicable, a suspension, expulsion or penalty to be contrary to this Act, whereupon the suspension, expulsion or penalty is void; and

(g) may in the same order or in a subsequent order determine what, if anything, in addition to or in substitution for the provision made in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), the employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions, or person, shall do or refrain from doing with respect to the prohibited act.

106(9)Where a complainant under subsection (1) alleges that he suffers irremediable harm from the continuing alleged violation of a provision of [sections 3](#sec3_smooth) to [9](#sec9_smooth), the Board on request by the applicant may, after consulting any employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions or other person that in its opinion is concerned, make such interim order as it in its discretion deems proper.

106(10)Where a request is received under subsection (9) the Chief Executive Officer shall serve notice of the complaint by telegram on any employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions or other person affected and shall either schedule the matter for hearing before the Board to be held within forty-eight hours, or refer the matter to a person appointed by him who shall report to the Board forthwith regarding the facts of the matter if he has not been successful in settling the complaint.

106(11)Upon receiving the report of a person to whom a matter was referred under subsection (10), the Board may, if it believes irremediable harm would result from the continuation of the act in question, issue an interim order forbidding the continuation of the act and in the same order the Board shall schedule a hearing forthwith to inquire fully into the complaint.

106(12)An order made under this section shall be served on the employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions, or other person affected by the order and the employer, employers’ organization, trade union, council of trade unions, or other person shall, notwithstanding the provisions of any collective agreement, comply with the order within the time provided in the order for compliance.

106(13)Where the trade union, council of trade unions, employer, employers’ organization, or person, has failed to comply with any of the terms of an order made under this section, any trade union, council of trade unions, employer, employers’ organization, person or employee affected by the order may, after the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the release of the order or the date provided in the order for compliance, whichever is later, notify the Board in writing of such failure, and thereupon the Board shall file a copy of the order, exclusive of the reasons therefor, in the prescribed form, in The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick, whereupon the order shall be entered as a judgment or order of that Court and is enforceable as such.

106(14)Where the matter of a complaint under subsection (1) has been settled, whether through the endeavours of the person appointed by the Chief Executive Officer, or otherwise, and the terms of the settlement have been put in writing and signed by the parties or their representatives, the settlement is binding upon the parties, the trade union, council of trade unions, employer, employers’ organization, person or employee who have agreed to the settlement and shall be complied with according to its terms, and a complaint that the trade union, council of trade unions, employer, employers’ organization, person or employee who has agreed to the settlement has not complied with the terms of the settlement shall be deemed to be a complaint under subsection (1).

106(15)Except where the Board rejects a complaint under subsection (6), when a person proceeds under this section to seek a remedy for any alleged wrongful refusal to employ, refusal to continue his employment, discharge, discrimination, intimidation, coercion, threat, or other act or practice contrary to this Act and referred to in subsection (1), no action, suit, or proceeding shall thereafter be brought by him in any court in respect of the alleged wrongful refusal to employ, refusal to continue his employment, discharge, discrimination, intimidation, coercion, threat or other act or practice contrary to this Act.

106(16)The Board shall not inquire into a complaint under this section unless the complaint is made within ninety days after the date on which the act complained of first occurred.

(b) where, in the taking of a representation vote, the Board determines that the employees are to be given a choice between two or more trade unions or councils of trade unions,

(i) to include on any ballot a choice indicating that an employee does not wish to be represented by a trade union or council of trade unions, and

(c) to bar an unsuccessful applicant for any period not exceeding ten months from the date of the dismissal of the unsuccessful application, or to refuse to entertain a new application by an unsuccessful applicant or by any of the employees affected by an unsuccessful application or by any person or trade union or council of trade unions representing such employees within any period not exceeding ten months from the date of the dismissal of the unsuccessful application,

(d) notwithstanding [sections 10](#sec10_smooth) and [23](#sec23_smooth) where an application has been made for certification of a trade union or council of trade unions as bargaining agent for employees in a bargaining unit, or for a declaration that the trade union or council of trade unions no longer represents the employees in a bargaining unit, and a final decision on the application has not been issued by the Board at the time a subsequent application for such certification or for such a declaration is made with respect to any of the employees affected by the original application,

(i) to treat the subsequent application as having been made on the date of the making of the original application,

(ii) to postpone consideration of the subsequent application until a final decision has been issued on the original application and thereafter consider the subsequent application subject to any final decision issued by the Board on the original application, or

(k) where in any proceedings before the Board the Board is satisfied that a bona fide mistake has been made in the completion of the technical details of a document or any details required to give validity to the document, to postpone disposition on the matter to allow the document to be corrected upon such terms as appear to the Board to be just.
