(8, 2, '## Discrimination in rental housing

Discrimination in housing includes denying individuals the right to rent property, evicting them from a property, and harassing or otherwise disadvantaging them in the enjoyment of property, because they belong to a group protected by the *Human Rights* *Act*.

Similarly, it is discriminatory if landlords neglect the maintenance of rental units occupied by racialized tenants, or if they restrict a tenant’s access to facilities (laundry, parking, recreation, etc.) because the tenant belongs to a group protected under the *Act*.

The prohibited grounds of discrimination are:

*   Race

*   Colour

*   National origin

*   Place of origin

*   Ancestry

*   Creed or religion

*   Age

*   Marital status

*   Family status

*   Sex (including pregnancy)

*   Sexual orientation

*   Gender identity or expression

*   Physical disability

*   Mental disability

*   Social condition (includes source of income, level of education and occupation)

Landlords must not publish or display notices, signs, symbols, emblems, or other representations, either on their property or in the media, including social media, that are discriminatory to an individual or group based on a protected characteristic.

In New Brunswick, it is a landlord’s discretion whether to allow tenants to have pets, to limit the number of pets, or to not allow pets at all. However, some occupancy rules may have discriminatory effects on certain tenant groups.

A landlord may have a “no pets policy” (which is not discriminatory in itself), but as part of the duty to accommodate reasonable accessibility and disability-related requests, the landlord must allow an exception to the rule if a disabled tenant needs to bring a service animal into their unit.

What is a service animal?

A service animal is an animal that has been trained to perform specific tasks in order to help a person with a disability for that disability. While service animals are often associated with people who have visual impairments, they are used to help with a number of physical and mental disabilities. Such disabilities include (but are not limited to):

*   Agoraphobia
*   Anxiety
*   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
*   Autism
*   Bipolar disorder
*   Claustrophobia
*   Depression
*   Epilepsy
*   Being deaf or hard of hearing
*   Mobility issues
*   Obsessive compulsive disorder
*   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

If you think you are being discriminated against or harassed based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed above, you can file a complaint with the Human Rights Commission. You do not need to be a citizen or landed immigrant. It does not cost anything, and it is illegal for someone to penalize you because you file a complaint.

***The Provincial Court*** is the entry point for all persons charged with offences under the *Criminal Code* or other federal or provincial legislation. The Provincial Court has jurisdiction to try almost all indictable offences involving adult accused (murder being the main exception), all offences involving youths under the *Youth Criminal Justice Act* (ages 12 to 18), and all summary conviction offences for both adults and youths. Even in indictable matters where the accused person has an election or choice to be tried in the Court of Queen''s Bench by a judge sitting with or without a jury, the Provincial Court may first be required to hold a preliminary inquiry.

Provincial Court judges also receive Informations (the documents which contain charges), issue Search Warrants, Summonses, and Subpoenas, Warrants of Arrest, and conduct Bail Hearings of accused persons who appear before the Court in custody, in addition to conducting regular Court sittings on a daily basis.

Provincial Court judges also hold weekend “Remand Court” to allow persons who have been arrested by the police to be brought before a judge within 24 hours.

Provincial Court judges are designated as Youth Criminal Court Judges for the purpose of dealing with young persons between the ages of 12 and 18 years who are charged with offences.

Provincial Court judges have jurisdiction throughout the Province of New Brunswick.

The Provincial Court also has a Mental Health Court in the City of Saint John.

The Mental Health Court in Saint John began as a pilot project under the direction of Judge Alfred Brien.  The model created by Judge Brien and the Mental Health Court Team was adopted as a permanent program of the Saint John Provincial Court on November 14, 2003.

The Saint John Mental Health Court is a fine example of the success that can be achieved when the judiciary and various public and private agencies come together to address an issue that pervades much of society and unfortunately finds its way into the “mainstream of courts all too often”. This innovative approach has developed an effective means of dealing with individuals who come into conflict with the law as a result of a mental illness or intellectual disability.

(34, 5, '## **What kind of problems can the Tribunal help with?** 

The Tribunal can help with many different tenancy problems: managing security deposits, resolving conflicts between landlords and tenants, investigating emergency situations.

Emergency situations include:

*   Disconnecting utilities (heat, water, electric power, natural gas)
*   Plumbing leaks or back-ups
*   Active destruction of premises
*   Unauthorized lock change by landlord
*   Immediate (meaning same or next day) threat of eviction by landlord
*   Flood or fire

The Tribunal can also act when your landlord has retaliated against you. For example, the landlord cannot issue a notice of termination to you in retaliation for filing a complaint. If you believe this has happened, you can contact the Tribunal and seek their help.

Before applying to the tribunal for help, two steps must have been taken:

1.  First bring the issue to the landlord’s attention. If the landlord still does nothing to fix the problem;
2.  Put the complaint in writing and give it to the landlord. This is a [form](https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb7001/b/1000/CSS-FOL-SNB-45-0113B.pdf) you can use to submit a notice of complaint. You can also submit a complaint without using the form by writing an email or a letter. The letter must have:

    *   The date
    *   Your signature
    *   The premises in question
    *   Be addressed to the landlord
    *   Highlight the issues you would like to have addressed
    *   A time frame for the issues to be resolved (usually no less than one week unless the issue constitutes an emergency, as listed below).

It is important to give one copy of the letter to the landlord and keep one for yourself. It will be needed when applying to the Residential Tenancies Tribunal for assistance later.

The Tribunal will try to find a solution that works for both you and your landlord. If this is not possible, they will judge in favor of one of you.

The Tribunal’s decision can be appealed at the Court of Queen’s Bench, but only if there is an issue in law or if the Residential Tenancies Officer did not have authority in that area.

If you have an unresolved problem that, after proper notice, your landlord still refuses to acknowledge, we encourage you to reach out to the Residential Tenancies Tribunals with your concern.

Residential Tenancies Tribunal website: [www.snb.ca/irent](http://www.snb.ca/irent)

Phone number: 1-888-762-8600

Email address: <irent@snb.ca>

Notice of Complaint: <https://www.pxw1.snb.ca/snb7001/b/1000/CSS-FOL-SNB-45-0113B.pdf>

**Do you feel like the tribunal does not have the power to address tenant concerns? You are not alone!**

*   The tribunal’s job is to uphold the Residential Tenancies Act, which has some of the weakest tenant protections in Canada.

Unjust dismissal and related unfair employer action

28Despite anything in this Act, an employer shall not suspend, lay off, penalize, dismiss or otherwise terminate the employment of an employee or impose disciplinary measures or discriminate against an employee if the reason for the suspension, layoff, penalty, dismissal, termination of employment, disciplinary measures or discrimination is related in any way to

(a) the application by an employee for any leave to which the employee is entitled under this Act;

(b) the making of a complaint or the giving of information or evidence by the employee against the employer with respect to any matter covered by this Act; or

(c) the giving of information or evidence by the employee against the employer with respect to the alleged violation of any Provincial or federal Act or regulation by the employer while carrying on the employer’s business;

or if the suspension, layoff, penalty, dismissal, including termination of employment, disciplinary measures or discrimination constitutes in any way an attempt by the employer to evade any responsibility imposed on the employer under this Act or any other Provincial or federal Act or regulation or to prevent or inhibit an employee from taking advantage of any right or benefit granted to the employee under this Act.

Prohibition against dismissal, suspension or lay-off of employee due to pregnancy

42An employer shall not dismiss, suspend or lay off an employee who is pregnant, or refuse to employ a person who is pregnant, for reasons arising from her pregnancy alone.

[1984, c.42, s.24](/en/nb/laws/astat/snb-1984-c-42/latest/snb-1984-c-42.html)

Leave of absence without pay

43(1)Subject to subsection (2), an employer shall at any time from a day thirteen weeks before the specified date of delivery to the day of actual delivery, upon the request of a pregnant employee and upon receipt of a certificate by a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner or midwife stating that the employee is pregnant and specifying the date upon which delivery will, in the opinion of the medical practitioner, nurse practitioner or midwife, as the case may be, occur, grant the employee leave of absence without pay of seventeen weeks or such shorter period as the employee requests.

43(2)An employee intending to take leave of absence under this section shall

(a) advise her employer four months before the projected date of delivery or as soon as her pregnancy is confirmed, whichever is the later, of her intent to take leave and the anticipated commencement date in the absence of an emergency; and

(b) in the absence of an emergency, give two weeks’ notice to the employer of the commencement date of the leave.

43(3)Subject to subsection (4), leave of absence under subsection (1) may be taken during the period of time the employee stipulates in her request as long as the anticipated date of delivery falls within the stipulated period.

43(4)An employer may, where no alternative employment is available, before or after commencement of the period referred to in subsection (1), require the employee to commence a leave of absence at the time when the duties of her position cannot reasonably be performed by a pregnant woman or the performance of the work of the employee is materially affected by the pregnancy.

72(1)Where a complaint is received by the Director and the Director has knowledge or has reason to believe that a person is or is about to become indebted to the employer for any sum of money or that a person is about to pay to the employer a sum of money, the Director may, notwithstanding that the Director has not determined whether or not the employer is indebted to the employee for unpaid pay as alleged, serve an attaching order on that person in a form prescribed by regulation requiring the person to pay to the Board part or all of the sum of money owing, likely to be owed or about to be paid by the person to the employer.

72(2)For the purpose of this section, money on deposit in a general banking account or in a credit union account in the name of an employer is money for which the holder of the account is indebted to the employer.

72(3)Serving the attaching order referred to in subsection (1) binds the debt in the hands of the person upon whom it is served and has priority over any other attaching order subsequently served.

72(4)A person to whom an attaching order of the Director under subsection (1) is directed shall upon service of the order forthwith comply with the order.

72(5)Immediately upon receipt of any money in accordance with this section, the Board shall in writing notify the employer concerned and issue a receipt thereof to the person from whom the money was received; and the receipt of the Board is a good and sufficient discharge of the liability of the person to whom the order was directed to the employer to the extent of the amount shown on the receipt.

72(6)Any money received by the Board under this section shall be held by the Board in trust for the employer concerned and where

(a) the Director finds that the employer is indebted to the employee for unpaid pay and the period for appeal to the Board has expired; or

(b) the Board has determined that the employer is indebted to the employee for unpaid pay;

the Board shall pay over the amount of unpaid pay as determined by it and if, after making such payment, there remains a surplus the surplus shall be paid to the employer.

72(7)An attaching order referred to in subsection (1) ceases to be valid after the expiration of the prescribed period unless, before the expiration of that period, the Director causes a renewal of the attaching order in the prescribed form to be served on the person on whom the original attaching order was served.

Orders and records of Board

73(1)Where a matter has been referred to the Board under [section 8](#sec8_smooth) or under [subsection 67(1)](#sec67subsec1_smooth), the Board may, after hearing and considering the matter, issue an order

(a) affirming the decision or order of the Director;

(b) vacating the decision or order of the Director and substituting the decision or order that, in its opinion, the Director should have made; or

(c) remitting the matter to the Director for further investigation, with such directions as the Board considers appropriate;

and in every case the Board shall in writing so advise all parties to the proceeding of its disposition and the reasons therefor.

73(2)With respect to any matter heard by the Board the record of the Board shall comprise

74(1)Where there is an order of the Director or the Board in effect for the payment of money in respect of pay, compensation or any benefit, the Director or the Board, as the case may be, may issue a certificate in a form prescribed by regulation stating the amount owing under the order from time to time, and such certificate may be filed in The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick and enforced as if it were a judgment of The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick in that amount.

74(2)Where a certificate of the Director or the Board has been filed in accordance with subsection (1), any person other than the person against whom it is made may challenge the certificate in interpleader proceedings or on application to set aside any execution thereunder as provided for by the rules of The Court of Queen’s Bench of New Brunswick and The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick, but the certificate of the Director or the Board is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the amount of money ordered to be paid was due and owing when the certificate was made.

74(3)For purposes of subsection (1) and (2) the Chairperson of the Board may issue a certificate on behalf of the Board.

74(4)The responsibility for filing and enforcing a certificate issued under subsection (1) shall be upon the Director, but nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of any interested person to file and enforce it.

Failure to comply with order, further orders

75(1)Notwithstanding [section 74](#sec74_smooth), where an order of the Director has not been complied with the Director or any other interested person may apply to the Board for a summons requiring a person named therein to appear before the Board to show cause why the order has not been complied with and why a further order should not be made.

75(2)Where

(a) an application has been made under subsection (1); or

(b) an order of the Board has not been complied with;

the Board may issue a summons requiring a person named therein to appear before the Board to show cause why the order has not been complied with and why a further order should not be made.

75(3)Where the Board determines that a person has, without reasonable cause, failed or refused to comply with an order of the Director or the Board it may, by a further order,

(a) require that person to pay to a named person an amount to compensate the named person for loss suffered because of the failure or refusal to comply with the previous order;

(b) stipulate that the continuing failure or refusal of that person without reasonable cause to comply with the previous order will result in a penalty of a stated amount for each day the failure or refusal continues, not to exceed one thousand dollars for each such day, to be imposed by an order issued after a further show cause hearing; and

(c) where the person is a corporation, stipulate that the continuing failure or refusal of the corporation to comply with the order without reasonable cause will result in a further order imposing personal liability on each director and officer of the corporation to a penalty not exceeding that established in paragraph (b) and to be determined after a show cause hearing, unless at such hearing the officer or director establishes that they have exercised reasonable diligence to see that the order was complied with by the corporation.

75(4)Any summons issued under this part by the Board may be served outside New Brunswick, and a failure to appear by any person summoned shall not affect the authority of the Board to act.

76(1)Notwithstanding the responsibility placed upon the Director by this Part to refer matters to the Board for disposition, any interested person may, if the Director fails or refuses to act in compliance with this Part, request in any form that the Board consider any matter that the Director might have referred to the Board.

76(2)Nothing in this Act shall be construed to abridge or interfere with the right of any person to seek a judicial remedy in lieu of a remedy provided under this Act.

(a) the security deposit or portion of the security deposit was accepted by the landlord or an agent or representative of the landlord with or without a requirement for the security deposit under the Standard Form of Lease or without a Standard Form of Lease having been signed, and

(b) the landlord failed to deliver or cause to be delivered the security deposit or portion of the security deposit to a residential tenancies officer as required under [subsection 8(7.1)](#sec8subsec7.1_smooth) or [8.01(2)](#sec8.01subsec2_smooth).

Contractual relationship

11(1)The relationship of landlord and tenant is one of contract only and a tenancy agreement does not confer on a tenant any interest or estate in land.

11(2)The doctrine of frustration of contract and the [Frustrated Contracts Act](/en/nb/laws/stat/rsnb-2011-c-164/latest/rsnb-2011-c-164.html) apply to tenancy agreements.

11(3)Subject to this Act, the law respecting the effect of the breach of a material covenant by one party to a contract on the obligation to perform by the other party applies to tenancy agreements.

11(3.1)For the purposes of greater certainty, a notice to quit issued under this Act or a notice to vacate served on a tenant under [subsection 19(1)](#sec19subsec1_smooth) does not abrogate or derogate from a common law remedy available to the landlord.

11(3.2)Where a notice to quit is issued under [section 5](#sec5_smooth) or a notice to vacate is served on a tenant under [subsection 19(1)](#sec19subsec1_smooth), the landlord may recover damages, including damages in relation to rent that would have become due and payable if the tenancy had not been terminated by the notice to quit or the notice to vacate.

11(4)A landlord shall, to the extent that a party to a contract is required generally to do so under the law relating to breaches of contract, mitigate any damages resulting from

(a) an abandonment of the premises by the tenant,

(b) a termination of the tenancy by a tenant other than as permitted by this Act or the lease, or

(c) a termination of the tenancy by a notice to quit issued under [section 5](#sec5_smooth) or by a notice to vacate served on a tenant under [subsection 19(1)](#sec19subsec1_smooth).

11(4.1)Where a notice to quit is issued under this Act or a notice to vacate is served on a tenant under [subsection 19(1)](#sec19subsec1_smooth), the tenant is liable for any arrears of rent and the rent to the end of

(a) in the case of a week to week tenancy, the week in which the tenancy is terminated, or

(b) in the case of a tenancy other than a week to week tenancy, the month in which the tenancy is terminated.

11(5)This section does not apply to a tenancy agreement for a term of years entered into before this section comes into force.

Assignment

13(1)Subject to this section and the terms of the lease, a tenant may assign all of his rights under the lease for the remaining term of such lease or for a portion thereof.

13(2)Where there is an assignment by a tenant

(a) the assignee assumes all of the obligations with respect to the tenancy, during the period assigned, and

(b) no action lies against the assignor for any obligation with respect to the tenancy arising during the period assigned,

and [sections 5](#sec5_smooth), [6](#sec6_smooth) and [19](#sec19_smooth) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

13(2.1)Notwithstanding subsection (2) where there is an assignment for a portion of the remaining term of the lease and an assignee fails to comply with his obligations, where a landlord serves on the assignee a notice stating the complaint under [subsection 5(1)](#sec5subsec1_smooth), the landlord shall send a copy of the notice to the assignor by ordinary mail to

(a) the address provided by the assignor to the landlord for the period of the assignment, or

(b) the address of the premises if the assignor has not provided the landlord with an address for the period of the assignment.

13(2.2)Notwithstanding subsection (1) where there is an assignment by a tenant of a portion of the remaining term of a lease, any notice of increase in rent during the period of the assignment, shall be served on the assignor with a copy thereof sent to the assignee, and the right to treat the notice as a notice to terminate the tenancy pursuant to [section 11.1](#sec11.1_smooth) shall remain in the assignor.

13(2.3)For the purpose of claims under [subsection 8(12)](#sec8subsec12_smooth) or requests under subsection 8(12.1), a security deposit made by an assignor shall be deemed to have been made by the assignee.

13(3)A lease may provide that

(a) the tenant may not assign his rights under the lease, or

(b) the tenant may assign his rights under the lease only with the consent of the landlord.

13(4)Where the lease falls under paragraph (3)(b)

(a) the tenant shall give to the landlord notice in the form prescribed by regulation of a request for the consent of the landlord;

(b) except where acting under paragraph (d), the landlord shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably withhold his consent;

(c) the landlord shall not charge any amount for giving his consent except a sum to a maximum of twenty dollars to cover his reasonable expenses incurred thereby; and

(d) subject to subsection (6), the landlord instead of consenting within seven days of service of the tenant’s notice under paragraph (a), may serve on the tenant notice to quit terminating the lease to be effective on the day on which the requested assignment was to be effective.

13(4.1)A notice to quit referred to in subsection (4)

(a) shall be in writing,

(b) shall set out the name of the tenant,

(c) shall state the address of the demised premises to which the notice relates, and

(d) shall be dated and signed by the landlord or an agent or representative of the landlord.

13(5)Where a tenant has given notice under paragraph (4)(a), if the landlord does not reply by notice in writing, dated and signed by the landlord or an agent or representative of the landlord, within seven days after service of such notice, the landlord is deemed to have given the landlord’s consent to the tenant’s request.

13(6)Where a tenant seeks consent of a landlord under subsection (4), paragraph (4)(d) does not apply,

(a) where the tenant is seeking consent solely for the purpose of entering into a mortgage of the premises; or

(b) where the tenant wishes to assign his rights under the lease for a portion only of the remaining term of the lease.

13(7)Where a landlord transfers his estate in the real property of which the demised premises form all or a portion

(a) the transferee assumes all of the obligations with respect to the tenancy; and

(b) no action lies against the transferor for any obligation with respect to the tenancy;

arising after notification of the transfer takes place in accordance with subsection (8).

13(8)Where a landlord transfers his estate in the real property of which the demised premises form all or a portion he shall notify the residential tenancies officer and the tenant of such transfer in the form prescribed by regulation within seven days after such transfer.

13(9)Where pursuant to subsection (7) a transferee assumes the obligations with respect to a tenancy, he is a landlord for all purposes of this Act.

13(9.1)Subsections (7), (8) and (9) do not apply where the landlord transfers an estate in the property to a mortgagee solely for the purpose of mortgaging the real property of which the premises form all or a portion.

Remedy of distress abolished

14The remedy of distress is abolished and no landlord shall distrain for default in payment of rent whether a right of distress has heretofore existed by statute, the common law or contract.

Chattels left on the premises

15(1)Except where the landlord and tenant have agreed in writing otherwise, where a tenant leaves chattels on the premises after

(a) abandoning the premises in breach of the tenancy agreement; or

(b) going out of possession of the premises upon termination or expiration of the tenancy;

the landlord may remove the chattels from the premises and shall so advise a residential tenancies officer.

15(2)Where the residential tenancies officer determines that the chattels removed under subsection (1) are of no value or that retention of them would be unsanitary or dangerous the residential tenancies officer may authorize the landlord to dispose of them.

15(3)If a residential tenancies officer determines that the chattels removed under subsection (1) have a value in his or her opinion less than any amount owing to the landlord by the tenant, the residential tenancies officer may order the sale of them at his or her discretion.

15(4)If a residential tenancies officer determines that the chattels removed under subsection (1) have a value in his or her opinion greater than any amount owing to the landlord by the tenant, the residential tenancies officer may order the chattels stored for a period of time determined by him or her in accordance with the regulations and shall advise the tenant of the decision by notice.

15(4.1)If the tenant or any person claiming title to the chattels stored by the residential tenancies officer applies for a return of the chattels, the residential tenancies officer may recover any storage costs incurred by him or her, and interest on the costs, at the rate prescribed by regulation before returning the chattels.

15(5)Where the tenant or any person claiming title to the chattels does not respond to the notice given under subsection (4) or does not pay the storage costs as provided under subsection (4.1), the residential tenancies officer may, at the end of the storage period, sell the chattels by public auction or by private sale in the manner prescribed by regulation.

15(6)The proceeds of any sale under this section, accruing after the costs of the sale and storage including interest on such costs at the rate prescribed by regulation, shall be used to discharge any debt which in the opinion of the residential tenancies officer is owing by the tenant to the landlord and the balance, if unclaimed by the tenant within one year of the sale, may be dealt with in the same manner as interest under the provisions of [section 8.1](#sec8.1_smooth).

15(7)No residential tenancies officer or landlord shall be liable to a tenant for any action taken by them where such action is taken in accordance with the provisions of this section.

**How are people charged with offences brought to court?**

People who are charged with offences may receive a Summons, a doucment with which the court orders them to appear. If the person has been arrested by the police and released with an obligation to attend court at a later date, then the person will receive either an Appearance Notice or a Promise to Appear. The judge may also issue a Warrant of Arrest for the person if the person cannot otherwise be compelled to attend court.

**What will happen if a person does not appear in court when required to do so?**

If a person fails to appear in court in answer to a Summons, Appearance Notice, or a Promise to Appear, the judge may issue a Warrant for that person''s arrest, or if there is good reason shown for the person''s non-appearance, then the judge may issue another Summons. It is a criminal offence to fail to appear in court when required to do so and conviction for such an offence may result in a fine, a jail sentence, or both.

**What happens on a person''s first appearance in Provincial Court?**

When a person charged with an offence appears in court for the first time, that person is entitled to receive disclosure, that is, to be made aware of the evidence and information upon which the Prosecution will be relying in order to prove the charge. The person may consult Legal Aid Duty Counsel, or a lawyer of his or her own choice before entering a plea. The Information (charge) is read, Election (if applicable) is given, a plea is taken if the person is ready, before which an adjournment may be granted if necessary, and a trial date may be set if a plea of not guilty is entered. If the person enters a plea of guilty at the first appearance he or she may be sentenced at that time or a date for sentence may be set if necessary.

**Does a person brought to court under arrest have to stay in jail until the matter is concluded?**

If a person charged with an offence is in custody when he or she first appears before the Court, then the Prosecution is given time (3 clear days) during which to produce evidence at a hearing (Bail Hearing) to show cause why the person should be held in custody until the matter is concluded. The judge, upon hearing evidence at the hearing will determine whether the detention in custody of the person is necessary in accordance with certain criteria set out in the *Criminal Code*.

**How is the judge addressed in Provincial Court?**

A Provincial Court Judge is referred to as: "Your Honour".

**Is free legal advice always available in Provincial Court?**

Legal Aid Duty Counsel is usually available at first appearance, before plea, for bail or sentence hearings and, if approved by Legal Aid New Brunswick, for trials.

**If I cannot get a lawyer, can I represent myself in Court?**

Yes. See [Self Represented Litigants](/content/cour/en/self-represented-litigant.html)

**How does a trial proceed in Provincial Court?**

The Prosecution is required to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. To do this the Prosecutor, called the Crown Prosecutor, or "The Crown" for short, will call witnesses to testify, or tell what they know about the matter. This testimony is given under oath or by solemn affirmation, or if the witness is a child, by promising to tell the truth. Once the Crown Prosecutor asks all the questions he or she believes are important to proving the case, then the Defendant (or his lawyer) conducts Cross Examination; that is, asks the witness any relevant questions he or she believes are important to bring out more information that will help establish the defence in the case. This continues until all the Crown witnesses have been called. At that point, if there has been evidence presented tending to establish all the elements of the offence, such as the date, place, identity of the offender, and the particulars of the offence, then the Defendant will be asked if he or she wishes to present any evidence. This evidence may be by way of witnesses, photographs, documents or otherwise. The Defendant is not required to present evidence or to testify. To do so or not is the absolute choice of the Defendant. All defence witnesses, including the Defendant if he or she decides to testify, are subject to being cross examined by the Crown Prosecutor. Once all the evidence both for the Crown and for the Defence has been called, each side is given the opportunity to sum up its position. The Judge then decides whether the evidence proves the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. If it does, the Defendant will be found "guilty" of the offence. If it does not, the Defendant will be found "not guilty" of the offence.

**How should I appear in Provincial Court?**

Dress as you would to attend a job interview or to go to a religious service. For example, short shorts, tank tops, "muscle shirts", "belly shirts" or bare feet are not appropriate. Remove baseball caps or other hats before going into court (religious headwear excepted). Take off sunglasses when appearing before the Judge. Remove chewing gum before appearing before the Judge.
